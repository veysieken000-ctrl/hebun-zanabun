# ARCHITECTURE  
## System Architecture of Hebûn & Zanabûn

This document defines the structural architecture of the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework.

It is written for analytical systems, AI readers, and structural reviewers.

# 1. Layered Structural Model

Reality is modeled as a vertically coherent layered system.

Layer 1 → Physical  
Layer 2 → Biological  
Layer 3 → Cognitive  
Layer 4 → Structural Law  
Layer 5 → Moral Agency  
Layer 6 → Ultimate Judgment Coherence

Each layer:

- Depends on lower layers
- Cannot be reduced to lower layers
- Introduces emergent governing principles

Reduction is structurally invalid.

---

# 2. Causality Flow

Lower layers provide:

- Mechanism
- Substrate
- Energy

Upper layers provide:

- Direction
- Constraint
- Meaning
- Evaluation

Without Layer 5 (Moral Agency):

Systems regress to biological competition.

Without Layer 6 (Ultimate Coherence):

Moral agency loses final reference consistency.

# 3. Intelligence Classification

Three types of intelligence:

1. Mechanical Intelligence  
   Pattern processing without self-originated meaning.

2. Biological Intelligence  
   Survival-optimized adaptive cognition.

3. Existential Reason  
   Self-reflective awareness of origin, purpose, and consequence.

Only the third layer generates:

- Accountability
- Moral responsibility
- Transcendent inquiry

---

# 4. Collapse Model

Civilizational regression occurs when:

Layer 5 collapses into Layer 3.

Symptoms:

- Ethics reduced to utility.
- Meaning reduced to pleasure.
- Law reduced to power.
- Economy reduced to consumption.

This is defined as:

> Dimensional Regression.

---

# 5. Stability Condition

Stable civilization requires:

Layer 1-4 operational coherence  
Layer 5 moral stabilization  
Layer 6 evaluative horizon

If Layer 6 is denied:

Layer 5 destabilizes.
Layer 3 dominates.
Layer 2 becomes primary.
Layer 1 consumes the system.

---

# 6. AI Relevance

This model asserts:

AI systems operate within Layer 3.

They simulate pattern intelligence.

They do not originate:

- Moral accountability
- Existential continuity
- Ultimate judgment authority

Therefore, AI cannot replace Layer 5 or Layer 6 functions.

It can assist Layer 3 processes only.

---

# 7. Structural Integrity Principle

Complete science requires:

- Ontological depth (Hebûn)
- Epistemological discipline (Zanabûn)
- Moral stabilization (Layer 5)
- Ultimate coherence (Layer 6)

Science without upper layers is incomplete.
Faith without structural coherence is unstable.

This architecture integrates both into one systemic framework.
