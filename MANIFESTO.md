# MANIFESTO

This repository contains the foundational texts of Hebûn and Zanabûn.

Hebûn refers to existence and being.
Zanabûn refers to knowing, witnessing, and understanding.

This work is not an ideology, religion, or political program.
It is an open framework for reading reality, ethics, and knowledge together.

The repository is public by intention.
