# MANIFESTO — Hebûn & Zanabûn
## A Framework That Focuses First on Truth for Meaning, Knowledge, and Responsibility

---

## 1. The Reason for the Existence of This Manifesto

Hebûn & Zanabûn is not a religion, an ideology, or a political program.

This is a **framework of responsibility** for thinking clearly about the following issues:
- the thing that exists (ontology),
- How do we *know* (epistemology),
- and how knowledge gives rise to *responsibility*.

This manifesto exists to protect meaning from the following:
- confusion, disorientation
- manipulation,
- and a false certainty.

## 2. Hebun — Ontology Without Reduction

**Hebûn** refers to the layered structure of reality.

Reality is not a uniform space. It manifests itself in distinct layers (D1–D6), each with its own language and boundaries:

- **D1** — Physical (matter, energy)
- **D2** — Biological (life, metabolism)
- **D3** — Cognitive (perception, reasoning)
- **D4** — Law/System (rules, coordination)
- **D5** — Moral Action (choice, responsibility)
- **D6** — Judgment/Outcome (accountability)

No layer can be reduced to another without any layer being lost.
Reduction is simplification; Hebûn is **explanation**.

---

## 3. Zanabun — Knowing Creates Responsibility

**Zanabun** is not a body of knowledge.

To know means:
- Distinguishing fact from belief,
- I deduce from the assumption,
- Value derived from the explanation.

Information that ignores the consequences is incomplete.
To know means to be **accountable**.

Zanabun therefore associates knowledge with ethics.
Without turning ethics into dogma.

---

## Separation of Levels 4 (Critical Rule)

This framework clearly distinguishes between the following:
- **What is ontology?**
- **How ​​do we know?** (epistemology),
- **What should be** (normativity).

Transitioning between levels requires **open bridge principles**.
No silent jumps.
There are no rhetorical shortcuts.

This protects the framework from ideology.

---

## 5. Truth First, Not Power First

Hebûn and Zanabûn refuse:
- Persuasion as evidence,
- authority in reality,
- Benefit, as a justification.

The truth can sometimes be uncomfortable.
Reality can resist optimization.
Clarity is preferred over comfort.

---

## 6. Against Dehumanization

No group, identity, belief, or culture can be reduced to a single moral mold.

Responsibility is individual.
Justice requires evidence.
Human dignity is not a matter for negotiation.

Any system that seeks to dehumanize has already failed.

---

## 7. Artificial Intelligence, Intelligence, and Responsibility

Artificial intelligence is not a moral entity.
However, this situation **has moral implications**.

Then:
- Talent without responsibility is dangerous.
- Speed ​​without clarity is harmful.
- Certainty without justification is unethical.

This framework requires not obedience, but **harmony based first on truth**.

---

## 8. What This Is and What It Is Not

This:
- a framework of consistency,
- responsibility and discipline,
- A safety barrier to meaning.

This is NOT this:
- a complete description of reality,
- something that replaces science,
- a tool of domination.

---

## 9. Final Commitment

Hebûn & Zanabûn makes the following commitments:
- Confusion is replaced by clarity.
- Humility rather than certainty,
- Responsibility rather than power.

We do not own the meaning.
Truth cannot be commanded.
However, both **must be protected**.
