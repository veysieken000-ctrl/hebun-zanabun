## Structural Overview of the Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework

### Abstract

The Hebûn–Zanabûn framework proposes a layered ontological and epistemic model integrating physical, biological, cognitive, normative, and moral dimensions within a structured hierarchy.

The framework does not reject empirical science.
It extends its scope by defining additional analytic layers and explicit boundary conditions.

The goal is structural coherence between ontology, epistemology, and moral accountability.

# 1. Ontological Model (Hebûn)

The system defines six analytical layers:

1. Physical (matter, energy, force)
2. Biological (life processes)
3. Cognitive (mind, reasoning, abstraction)
4. Structural Law (systemic order, rule patterns)
5. Moral Agency (ethical responsibility, intention)
6. Accountability Horizon (ultimate consequence layer)

These are analytical layers, not spatial dimensions.

Each layer:
- Emerges from lower layers
- Cannot be reduced without explanatory loss
- Maintains partial autonomy

Reduction from higher to lower layers produces structural incompleteness.

---

# 2. Epistemic Model (Zanabûn)

Core claim:

Knowledge must declare:
- Its ontological layer
- Its method
- Its boundary conditions

Method alignment:

Layer 1–3 → empirical / formal methods  
Layer 4 → structural analysis  
Layer 5 → ethical reasoning  
Layer 6 → metaphysical accountability modeling  

Category errors occur when methods mismatch layers.

Universal claims without declared boundaries are considered epistemically unstable.

---

# 3. Moral Structure

The system asserts:

Moral agency exists at Layer 5.
Responsibility requires cognition.
Power requires audit.

Utility-based reduction of human value is considered structurally insufficient.

Moral denial does not eliminate consequence; it transfers risk to systemic instability.

---

# 4. Collapse Criteria

The framework explicitly defines collapse conditions:

- Denial of moral agency → deterministic reduction
- Denial of empirical layers → anti-scientific drift
- Undefined scope → epistemic instability
- Unchecked authority → governance decay

Structural stability requires:

- Layer coherence
- Method-layer alignment
- Accountability mechanisms
- Revision capacity

---

# 5. Economic Application (Mabûn)

Economic modeling is treated as a Layer 5 application:

Principle:
Minimum biological security + Maximum existential dignity.

Economic value is evaluated across:
- Survival necessity
- Social cohesion
- Moral integrity

Pure consumption-driven models are considered dimensionally incomplete.

---

# 6. Aesthetic Dimension (Zelal–Delal Model)

The system includes a dual aesthetic model:

Zelal → simplicity, purity, structural clarity  
Delal → expressive beauty, communicative attraction  

Lower layers reflect Zelal.
Higher layers express Delal.

---

# 7. Research Orientation

This framework invites:

- Logical testing
- Structural critique
- Layer-boundary analysis
- Collapse scenario modeling

It does not claim infallibility.

It claims:

Defined layers.
Defined limits.
Defined revision protocol.

---

# 8. Final Position

The framework positions itself as:

Layered Structural Realism
with
Explicit Moral Accountability Integration.

It seeks coherence between:

Ontology
Epistemology
Ethics
Governance
Economics

It remains open to analytical challenge
within declared boundary conditions.
