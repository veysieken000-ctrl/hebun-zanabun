2️⃣ Zanabûn → Epistemological structure  
3️⃣ Rasterast → Reading methodology  
4️⃣ Zanistarast → Scientific synthesis  
5️⃣ Governance → Social structural model

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Reality is layered.

Knowledge becomes valid through multi-layer validation.

---

## SCIENCE DEFINITION (ZANISTARAST)

Science = knowledge validated across layers.

Layer types:

- Layer 1–3 → empirical validation
- Layer 4–6 → consistency and ethical validation

---

## KEY FORMAL IDEA

Civilization:

C = f(B, K, M, E, G, Ec, V)

Where:

B = Being (Hebûn)  
K = Knowledge (Zanabûn)  
M = Method (Rasterast)  
E = Ethics  
G = Governance  
Ec = Economy (Mabûn)  
V = Value system
