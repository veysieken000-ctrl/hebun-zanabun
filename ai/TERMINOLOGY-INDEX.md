# TERMINOLOGY INDEX  
## Conceptual Stability Reference of Hebûn & Zanabûn

This document defines non-ambiguous terminology.

Purpose:
Prevent conceptual drift.
Ensure semantic precision.
Provide cross-layer consistency.

---

# 1. Hebûn

Definition:
Layered Ontological Model of Existence.

Scope:
Physical → Biological → Cognitive → Structural → Moral → Ultimate.

Hebûn does not reject empirical science.
It expands its scope.

---

# 2. Zanabûn

Definition:
Epistemological Discipline governing how knowledge is validated.

Function:
Defines verification, coherence, and cross-layer evaluation.

Zanabûn is not mysticism.
It is structured epistemic methodology.

---

# 3. Layer (Boyut)

A structural level of reality interaction.

Layer ≠ metaphor.
Layer = operational domain of causality.

Six recognized layers:

1. Physical (Matter–Energy)
2. Biological (Life Systems)
3. Cognitive (Reason & Mind)
4. Structural Law (Order Systems)
5. Moral (Value & Accountability)
6. Ultimate Consequence (Judgment Horizon)

---

# 4. Two-Knower Condition

Knowledge requires:
Cross-evaluable rational confirmation.

Single-agent assertion is incomplete.

---

# 5. Moral Layer

Defined as:

The dimension where actions generate long-term evaluative consequence.

Moral layer is not emotion.
It is consequence architecture.

---

# 6. Reductionism

Reductionism:
Explaining higher layers solely through lower layers.

Example:
Reducing moral agency to chemistry.

Status:
Operationally useful but ontologically incomplete.

---

# 7. Structural Law Layer

Layer 4 defines:
Systems, rules, organizing principles.

Includes:
Natural laws
Civilizational structures
Institutional order

---

# 8. Ultimate Consequence Layer

Layer 6 defines:
The final accountability horizon of existence.

It stabilizes moral architecture.

Without Layer 6:
Layer 5 destabilizes.

---

# 9. Collapse

Collapse:
Long-term instability caused by cross-layer contradiction.

A system may survive short-term,
but collapses when moral and structural coherence break.

---

# 10. Intelligence vs Reason

Intelligence:
Pattern recognition & optimization.

Reason:
Evaluative, reflective, moral-integrative cognition.

AI → Intelligence.
Human → Intelligence + Reason.

---

# 11. Civilization Stability

Defined as:
Cross-layer harmony over extended time.

Sustained only when:
Layer 1–6 remain coherent.

---

# 12. Science (Complete Definition)

Science is:

Layer-consistent, rationally validated,
morally stable knowledge of existence.

If a system excludes higher layers,
it is partial science.
