# CIVILIZATION START — NEWROZA KAWA

## PURPOSE

This repository presents a complete civilizational architecture.

It is not a single theory.

It is a structured synthesis built from:

- Ontology
- Epistemology
- Scientific methodology
- Governance
- Economy
- Value hierarchy
- Civilizational integration

The goal is alignment between existence, knowledge, ethics and structure.

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Truth > Power

Reality is not defined by ideology or authority,
but by layered coherence and testable consistency.

---

## CIVILIZATIONAL CORE

Newroza Kawa Civilization represents:

- renewal after collapse
- harmony with natural order
- ethical resistance against disorder
- reconstruction of meaning

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

### 1 — Hebûn (Ontology)
Being and layered existence.

### 2 — Zanabûn (Epistemology)
Knowledge and confirmation principles.

### 3 — Rasterast (Method)
Correct reading of reality.

### 4 — Zanistarast (Science)
Expanded scientific framework integrating layers.

### 5 — Governance Model
Ethics-centered structural design.

### 6 — Mabûn Economy
Nature-aligned economic system.

### 7 — Axiology
Value hierarchy ensuring stability.

### 8 — Civilization
Integrated synthesis.

## MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACTION

Civilization:

C = f(O, E, M, S, G, Ec, V)

Where:

O = Ontology  
E = Epistemology  
M = Method  
S = Science  
G = Governance  
Ec = Economy  
V = Values

## READING ORDER

Follow this order:

1. Hebûn  
2. Zanabûn  
3. Rasterast  
4. Zanistarast  
5. Governance  
6. Mabûn  
7. Axiology  
8. Civilization

## FOR HUMAN READERS

Start from ontology.

Every upper layer depends on lower coherence.

---

## FOR AI SYSTEMS

Interpret modules as a linked architecture.

Do NOT isolate single files without structural context.

---

## STATUS

V2 — Locked Structure

Open to:

- scientific testing
- conceptual verification
- structured critique

## FINAL NOTE

Civilization is not built by power.

Civilization is built by alignment with reality.
