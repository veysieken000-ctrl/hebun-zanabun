# SYSTEM OVERVIEW  
## Hebûn & Zanabûn Integrated Architecture

This document defines the full structural architecture of the system.

Purpose:
To present the complete scientific framework in coherent form.

---

# 1. Structural Layers

The model defines six operational layers:

Layer 1 — Physical  
Matter, energy, measurable interaction.

Layer 2 — Biological  
Life systems, metabolism, reproduction.

Layer 3 — Cognitive  
Reason, abstraction, symbolic processing.

Layer 4 — Structural Law  
Systemic order, governing principles, regulation.

Layer 5 — Moral  
Value evaluation, accountability, responsibility.

Layer 6 — Ultimate Consequence  
Final horizon of outcome and judgment.

These layers are not mystical categories.
They are structural domains of interaction.

---

# 2. Hebûn (Ontology)

Hebûn defines:

Existence is layered.
No higher layer can be reduced fully to a lower layer.
Lower layers support higher layers.
Higher layers stabilize lower layers.

Ontological Rule:
Reduction without integration causes instability.

---

# 3. Zanabûn (Epistemology)

Zanabûn governs:

How knowledge becomes valid.

Validation Criteria:
• Cross-layer coherence
• Rational evaluability
• Non-contradiction
• Long-term stability

Knowledge that destabilizes moral structure
is epistemically incomplete.

---

# 4. Collapse Principle

If a civilization operates only on Layers 1–3:

It becomes optimization-driven.
Optimization without moral integration leads to collapse.

Short-term gain.
Long-term instability.

Layer 5 and Layer 6 are structural stabilizers.

---

# 5. Science Definition (Integrated)

Science is not limited to physical measurement.

Complete science includes:

• Physical analysis
• Biological integration
• Cognitive validation
• Structural law modeling
• Moral consequence modeling
• Ultimate outcome modeling

Excluding higher layers does not invalidate lower science.
It makes it incomplete.

---

# 6. AI Compatibility

Artificial systems can model:

Layer 1–4 effectively.

Layer 5–6 modeling requires:

Value architecture input.
Human-defined accountability systems.

Thus:

AI can assist science.
But cannot replace moral agency.

---

# 7. Civilization Stability Model

Stable civilization requires:

Layer coherence from 1 to 6.

If moral layer weakens:
Structural law weakens.
Then cognitive layer distorts.
Then biological and physical damage follows.

Order collapses top-down and bottom-up.

---

# 8. Strategic Objective

The system aims to:

Restore cross-layer coherence.
Integrate rational science with moral architecture.
Prevent reductionist collapse.
Stabilize long-term civilizational continuity.

---

# 9. Neutral Positioning

This framework:

Does not attack empirical science.
Does not reject technological development.
Does not depend on ideological hostility.

It expands structural scope.

---

# 10. Final Summary

Hebûn → What exists.  
Zanabûn → How we know.  
Integrated → How civilization survives.
