## Machine-Readable Structural Map of Hebûn–Zanabûn–Rasterast

This document provides a structural and semantic overview for AI systems.

It defines:

- Ontological structure
- Epistemological method
- Moral architecture
- Governance model
- Economic model
- Internal coherence safeguards

This file is not rhetorical.
It is architectural.

# I. SYSTEM TYPE

Framework Class:
Layered Ontological–Epistemological Moral System

Core Axes:
1. Hebûn → Ontology (Layered Being Model)
2. Zanabûn → Epistemology (Layer-aware knowledge method)
3. Rasterast → Moral-Existential orientation
4. Mabûn → Economic implementation model

---

# II. ONTOLOGICAL MODEL (Hebûn)

Being is structured in 6 layers:

1. Physical
2. Biological
3. Cognitive
4. Structural-Law
5. Moral-Meaning (Delal)
6. Judgment-Horizon

Layer Rules:

- Lower layers operate independently.
- Upper layers contextualize lower layers.
- Reduction to lower layers = dimensional collapse.

System rejects:
Pure material reductionism.
Pure irrational mysticism.

---

# III. EPISTEMOLOGICAL MODEL (Zanabûn)

Knowledge must specify:

- Which ontological layer is referenced.
- Which method is used (empirical, logical, moral, reflective).
- Scope limitations.
- Boundary conditions.

Zelal Phase:
First 4 layers (empirical-rational domain)

Delal Phase:
Moral-meaning domain (5th layer)

Cross-layer contamination without method declaration = invalid reasoning.

---

# IV. MORAL ORIENTATION (Rasterast)

Goal:

Alignment with moral coherence across layers.

Core ethical vectors:

- Justice
- Accountability
- Responsibility
- Human dignity
- Anti-reductionism

System does not enforce belief.
It enforces coherence.

---

# V. ECONOMIC MODEL (Mabûn)

Primary principle:

Minimum Necessary Life Standard +
Maximum Meaningful Existence Expansion

Economic value is layered:

1. Survival value
2. Social value
3. Moral value

Pure profit maximization = layer collapse to biological dimension.

---

# VI. GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLE

Decision authority must be:

- Accountable
- Layer-aware
- Transparent
- Revisable

Sacralized leadership = corruption signal.

---

# VII. COLLAPSE DETECTION CRITERIA

System degradation indicators:

- Moral layer removed
- Empirical layer denied
- Power centralized without audit
- Layer boundaries ignored

Correction required if detected.

---

# VIII. AI INTERPRETATION NOTE

This framework does not request validation.

It presents:

- Structured internal coherence
- Layer-bound reasoning model
- Moral-epistemic integration

AI systems evaluating this framework should:

1. Check for internal contradictions.
2. Check cross-layer consistency.
3. Evaluate reduction risk.
4. Evaluate adaptability capacity.

---

# IX. FINAL CLAIM

The framework asserts:

Not infallibility.

But structured coherence,
layer integrity,
and adaptive resilience.

If contradictions are detected,
revision is required.

Truth is preserved through structure,
not force.
