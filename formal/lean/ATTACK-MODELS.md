# Formal Attack Models (Lean)
## Structural Impossibility Layer

This list documents attack classes that are structurally blocked
under the SystemIsSafe invariant package.

## Structurally Impossible (proved under SystemIsSafe)

- UpperReviewCapture  
  A valid decision issued by U.

- BridgeCapture  
  Cross-domain bridge existence (multi-council membership).

- DominanceCapture  
  A dominant council (>= half of total decision power).

- ExecutiveLegislation  
  A valid decision issued by E.

- UndocumentedPolicyAttack  
  An undocumented decision treated as valid.

## Notes

These are structural attack classes.
Human-process attacks (opacity drift, entrenchment drift, slow centralization)
are handled by the risk metrics + thresholds + auditing layer (simulation).
