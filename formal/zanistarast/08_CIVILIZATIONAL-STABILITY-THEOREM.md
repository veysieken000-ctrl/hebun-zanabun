# Civilizational Stability Theorem

Statement:

A civilization remains stable
iff moral coherence dominates utility maximization.

---

## Definitions

Utility(U)
Justice(J)
MoralLayer(L5)
LawLayer(L4)

---

## Theorem

If:

Dominant(U) ∧ ¬Dominant(J)

Then:

Collapse(L5)
→ Collapse(L4)
→ CognitiveInstability
→ StructuralDecay

Conversely:

If:

Dominant(J) ∧ Accountability(L6)

Then:

LawConsistency
∧ SocialTrust
∧ LongTermStability

---

## Proof Sketch

1. Law requires shared norm.
2. Shared norm requires moral reference.
3. Without moral reference, law reduces to power.
4. Power competition destabilizes system.
5. Therefore moral dominance is necessary condition.
