# Type System & Semantics

## Types
Entity
Proposition
KnowledgeClaim = (proposition, method, evidence, layer)

Layer ∈ {L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6}

## Validity Condition
V(k) is true iff:
- k has a defined type
- k uses declared operators
- k respects layer constraints
- k satisfies Two-Subject Condition

## Two-Subject Condition
Valid knowledge requires at least two subjects sharing a verification ground.

## Degeneration Rule
Systematic rejection of L5 leads toward L2 optimization dominance.
