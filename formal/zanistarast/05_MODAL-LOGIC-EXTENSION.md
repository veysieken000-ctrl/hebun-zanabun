# Modal Logic Extension — Zanistarast

Purpose:
Extend the Zanistarast formal system with modal operators 
to represent necessity, possibility, and moral obligation.

---

## 1. Modal Operators

□P : Necessarily P  
◇P : Possibly P  
O(P) : Morally obligatory that P  
F(P) : Forbidden that P  
P(P) : Permissible that P

## 2. Layer Mapping

Physical (L1–L3):
- Governed by □ (natural necessity)

Law Layer (L4):
- □ under constraint systems

Moral Layer (L5):
- Governed by O / F / P operators

Hukm Layer (L6):
- Final modal resolution operator

---

## 3. Core Modal Axioms

M1: □P → ◇P  
(Necessity implies possibility)

M2: O(P) → ◇P  
(Obligation implies feasibility)

M3: O(P) → ¬O(¬P)  
(No contradictory obligation)

M4: If L5 collapses → moral modality undefined

M5: If L6 active → modal closure enforced

## 4. Moral Degeneration Theorem

If a system rejects O and F operators,
then decision-making reduces to utility optimization (L2 dominance).

Formally:

Reject(O,F) → Reduction(L5)  
Reduction(L5) → Optimization(L2)

Thus:
Reject(O,F) → Degeneration toward L2

## 5. Modal Civilization Stability Condition

Stable Civilization ⇔

□(LawConsistency) ∧  
O(Justice) ∧  
O(Accountability) ∧  
FinalResolution(L6)

---

## 6. Interpretation

Modal logic here is not theological assertion,
but structural modeling of obligation and necessity
within layered ontology.
