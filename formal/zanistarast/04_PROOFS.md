# Formal Proof Skeletons

Theorem 1:
Valid knowledge implies Two-Subject Condition.
Proof: Directly from AX1.

Theorem 2:
Violation of Law layer implies invalidity.
Proof:
Assume V(k).
If k violates L4, contradiction arises.
Contradiction invalidates agreement.
Therefore not V(k).

Theorem 3:
Stable civilization requires L5 ∧ L6.
Proof:
Without L5 → norm collapse.
Without L6 → enforcement collapse.
Thus stability requires both.
