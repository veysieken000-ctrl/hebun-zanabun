# Mathematical Condensed Structure

Let:

S = System
L = {L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6}

Define stability function:

Stability(S) = f(L4, L5, L6)

Where:

f = 1 if (L5 coherent ∧ L4 consistent ∧ L6 enforced)
f = 0 otherwise

---

Reduction Model:

If L5 → null

Then:

S → L2-dominant

Meaning:

Human → Biological agent
Ethics → Utility
Civilization → Competitive equilibrium

---

Integrity Model:

If:

L5 active ∧ L6 accountable

Then:

S → Moral-coherent civilization

---

Compact Form:

Stable(S) ⇔ (M ∧ J ∧ H)

Where:

M = MoralIntegrity
J = JusticeCoherence
H = HigherAccountability
