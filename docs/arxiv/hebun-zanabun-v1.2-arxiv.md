## Abstract

This paper presents the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework, a layered structural system integrating ontology (Hebûn), epistemology (Zanabûn), ethical integration, and civilizational modeling.

Unlike manifesto-based models, this framework proposes a formal structural architecture that evolves through stabilization stages:

- v1.0 — Ontological & Epistemological Core
- v1.1 — Ethical Integration
- v1.2 — Civilizational Activation

The model proposes a hak-centered structural coherence principle combining ontological grounding, epistemic accountability, and normative governance architecture.

## 1. Ontological Layer (Hebûn)

Hebûn defines structured being through layered dimensional architecture.

Core properties:
- Layered existence
- Structural dependency
- Dimensional coherence

---

## 2. Epistemological Layer (Zanabûn)

Zanabûn formalizes knowledge as responsibility-bound witnessing.

Core properties:
- Witness-based epistemology
- Accountability principle
- Ethical-knowledge coupling

---

## 3. Ethical Integration Layer

Ethics is not external to ontology but structurally emergent.

Formal structure:

H = Ontology  
Z = Epistemology  
E = Ethical integration  

System coherence function:

S = f(H, Z, E)

---

## 4. Civilizational Layer

The framework extends into governance and social architecture.

Civilizational activation requires:

- Normative stability
- Epistemic accountability
- Ethical governance
- Institutional coherence

---

## 5. System Stabilization Model

Stage 1: Structural grounding  
Stage 2: Ethical stabilization  
Stage 3: Civilizational activation  

---

## Conclusion

The Hebûn–Zanabûn model proposes a structural, layered, and formally expandable civilizational architecture grounded in hak-centered ontology and responsibility-bound epistemology.
