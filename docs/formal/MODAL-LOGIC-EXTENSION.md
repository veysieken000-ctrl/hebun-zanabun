# Modal Logic Extension
## Hebûn–Zanabûn Formal Modal Layer

This document defines the modal structure of the 6D Ontological Framework.

---

## 1. Modal Operators

□P = Necessary (zorunlu varlık / hüküm)
◇P = Possible (imkân alanı)
ΔP = Ethical validation (ahlaki onay)
⊕P = Expansion of being
⊖P = Contraction of being
⊗ = Dimensional interaction operator
→ = Implication
↔ = Equivalence

---

## 2. Dimensional Mapping

D1 = Physical layer  
D2 = Biological layer  
D3 = Cognitive layer  
D4 = Normative law layer  
D5 = Ethical layer  
D6 = Judgment layer  

---

## 3. Core Ontological Axiom

□(D1 → D2 → D3 → D4 → D5 → D6)

Interpretation:
Higher dimensional layers necessarily presuppose lower layers.

---

## 4. Ethical Necessity Principle

□(ΔP → ⊕P)

If an action is ethically valid,
expansion of being is necessary.

---

## 5. Contraction Principle

□(¬ΔP → ⊖P)

If ethical validation fails,
contraction of being is necessary.

---

## 6. Judgment Closure

□(D5 ⊗ D6 → Final State)

Ethical layer interacting with judgment layer
produces ontological closure.

---

## 7. Second-Subject Condition

□(Knowledge → SecondSubjectVerification)

Truth requires dual-subject validation.

---

## 8. Meta-Level Constraint

□(Law ≠ HumanConstructionOnly)

Normative structure is not reducible to human agreement.

---

System Status:
Modal layer formally defined.
