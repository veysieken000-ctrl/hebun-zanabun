# Unified Meta-Architecture
Hebûn–Zanabûn Structural Integration Layer

---

## I. Objective

This document defines the meta-structural layer
that unifies ontology, epistemology, and ethics
into a coherent civilizational system.

It does not define content.
It defines structural coherence conditions.

---

## II. Layer Map

Level 0 — Logical Consistency  
Level 1 — Ontological Structuring  
Level 2 — Epistemic Stabilization  
Level 3 — Ethical Alignment  
Level 4 — Civilizational Activation  

Meta-Level — Structural Self-Regulation

---

## III. Coherence Condition

A system S is structurally valid if:

1. Logical consistency is preserved
2. Ontological layering is defined
3. Epistemic collapse is prevented
4. Ethical alignment maps onto ontological layer
5. Civilizational activation emerges as consequence

If any condition fails → regression to lower level.

---

## IV. Recursive Stability

Let:

S₀ = Logical Base  
S₁ = Ontological Core  
S₂ = Epistemic Structure  
S₃ = Ethical Integration  
S₄ = Civilizational Model  

Meta(S) ensures:

Stability(Sₙ) → Enables(Sₙ₊₁)

If Instability(Sₙ) → Collapse to Sₙ₋₁

---

## V. Structural Principle

Structure precedes activation.  
Alignment precedes expansion.  
Stability precedes civilization.

---

## VI. System Identity

The framework is not manifesto-based.
It is structurally emergent.

Civilization is treated as a systems-level state transition.
