# Proof Tree Structure
## Hebûn–Zanabûn Ontological Proof Architecture

This document defines the structural proof tree of the 6D framework.

---

# LEVEL 0 — FOUNDATIONAL AXIOM

A0: Being exists.

---

# LEVEL 1 — STRUCTURAL NECESSITY

A1: Being requires structure.
A2: Structure requires law.
A3: Law requires intelligibility.
A4: Intelligibility requires cognition.

Therefore:
A5: Cognition is structurally necessary.

---

# LEVEL 2 — DUAL SUBJECT CONDITION

A6: Knowledge requires validation.
A7: Validation requires at least two cognitive agents.

Therefore:
A8: Second Subject Condition is necessary.

---

# LEVEL 3 — DIMENSIONAL STACK

A9: Physical coherence (D1)
A10: Biological organization (D2)
A11: Cognitive processing (D3)
A12: Normative structuring (D4)
A13: Ethical evaluation (D5)
A14: Judgment resolution (D6)

Hierarchy Rule:
Dn+1 presupposes Dn

---

# LEVEL 4 — ETHICAL NECESSITY

A15: Actions affect being-state.
A16: Ethical validation determines direction.
A17: Expansion or contraction follows ethical status.

Thus:
A18: Ethical layer determines ontological trajectory.

---

# LEVEL 5 — JUDGMENT CLOSURE

A19: All trajectories resolve.
A20: Resolution defines final ontological state.

Therefore:
A21: Judgment layer is structurally required.

---

# ROOT CONCLUSION

C1:
6D Structure is logically necessary
given:

- Being exists
- Knowledge requires validation
- Ethics affects trajectory
- Resolution must occur

System is internally coherent.
