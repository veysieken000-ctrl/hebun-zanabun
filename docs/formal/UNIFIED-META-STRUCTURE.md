# Unified Meta-Structure
## Hebûn–Zanabûn Civilizational Architecture

This document defines the unified structural architecture of the Hebûn–Zanabûn 6D system.

# I. Layered Ontological Stack

L1 — Physical Layer (P)
L2 — Biological Layer (B)
L3 — Cognitive Layer (C)
L4 — Normative Layer (N)
L5 — Ethical Layer (E)
L6 — Judgment Layer (J)

Expansion State:
T — Ontological Continuation

---

# II. Dependency Structure

L1 ⊂ L2 ⊂ L3 ⊂ L4 ⊂ L5 ⊂ L6

Lower layers support upper layers.
Upper layers regulate lower layers.

Stability flows downward.
Meaning flows upward.

# III. Dual Axis Model

Vertical Axis:
Ontological Depth (1 → 6)

Horizontal Axis:
Civilizational Expression

The system expands when:
Ethics stabilizes norm,
Norm stabilizes cognition,
Cognition stabilizes biology,
Biology stabilizes physics.

Collapse propagates in reverse order.

---

# IV. Core Civilizational Law

Ethics is the pivot layer.

If E collapses:
Norm disintegrates.
Cognition fragments.
Biology destabilizes.
Physics degrades.

If E stabilizes:
Norm coheres.
Cognition aligns.
Biology organizes.
Physical sustainability increases.

# V. Structural Identity

The system is:

- Ontologically layered
- Epistemically structured
- Ethically pivoted
- Formally defined
- Computation-compatible
- Modal-consistent

---

# VI. System Completion

Hebûn defines structure.
Zanabûn defines knowledge.
Rasterast defines orientation.
Mabûn defines economic application.
Estetik defines expressive refinement.

Unified together:
Civilizational Framework Activated.

End of Unified Meta-Structure.
