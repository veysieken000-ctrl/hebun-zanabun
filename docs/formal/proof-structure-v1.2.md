# Hebûn–Zanabûn Proof Structure v1.2

This document defines the formal derivation structure of the 6-layer model.

---

## Axiom 1 — Ontological Existence

∀x (Exists(x) → Structured(x))

Existence implies structure.

---

## Axiom 2 — Structural Coherence

∀x (Structured(x) → Layered(x))

Structure implies layered organization.

---

## Axiom 3 — Layer Dependency

∀x (Layered(x) → Interdependent(x))

Layers cannot exist independently.

---

## Axiom 4 — Rational Agent Condition

∀x (Rational(x) → MoralResponsibility(x))

Rationality implies moral responsibility.

---

## Axiom 5 — Ethical Necessity

∀x (MoralResponsibility(x) → JusticeRequired(x))

Justice is required for rational agents.

---

## Theorem 1 — Stability Condition

∀x (
    Structured(x)
    ∧ Rational(x)
    ∧ Justice(x)
    → Stable(x)
)

---

## Theorem 2 — Collapse Condition

∀x (
    Rational(x)
    ∧ ¬Justice(x)
    → Collapse(x)
)

---

## Theorem 3 — Civilizational Continuity

∀C (
    ∀x∈C Stable(x)
    → Stable(C)
)

---

## Theorem 4 — Ethical Collapse

∀C (
    ∃x∈C ¬Justice(x)
    ∧ Influence(x)
    → Instability(C)
)

---

## Meta-Theorem — 6th Layer Necessity

∀x (
    Rational(x)
    → Requires(Meta-Layer)
)

If rationality exists, meta-ethical structure is necessary.

---

## Conclusion

The 6-layer model is not metaphysical addition,
but a structural necessity derived from rational agency.
