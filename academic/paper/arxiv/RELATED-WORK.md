# RELATED WORK — Positioning & Academic Context (v1)

This repository provides an axiomatic onto-epistemic framework (Hebûn–Zanabûn) with a civilizational modeling layer.
The work is positioned at the intersection of:

- Formal ontology and layered metaphysical modeling
- Epistemic logic and knowledge validation constraints
- Normative systems (ethics + governance integration)
- AI-aligned symbolic structures (machine-readable indexing)

## Scope of contribution
1) A minimal axiomatic core (A1..A12) supporting layered being/knowledge/norm structures  
2) A theorem catalog (T1..T10) with proof skeletons  
3) A machine-tractable structure for AI indexing and review stability  
4) A civilizational layer activation: normative governance binding (Ethics ★ Hukm)
