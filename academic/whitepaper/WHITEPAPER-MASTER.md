# Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework  
## Unified Ontology & Ethical-Civilizational Model

Version: v1.2  
Status: Civilizational Phase Activated

# Abstract

This paper presents a six-layer ontological model (Hebûn) integrated with an epistemological reliability structure (Zanabûn).

Unlike reductionist four-layer models (physical–biological–cognitive–law), this framework introduces:

- Moral Layer (L5)
- Hukm Layer (L6)

The model proposes that civilizational stability depends on moral dominance over utility dominance.

# 1. Ontological Structure (Hebûn)

L1 — Physical  
L2 — Biological  
L3 — Cognitive  
L4 — Law  
L5 — Moral  
L6 — Hukm (Final Accountability)

Layer dependency principle:

L(n) is stable only if L(n+1) is coherent.

---

# 2. Epistemological Foundation (Zanabûn)

Knowledge requires:

- Subject
- Object
- Coherence
- Ethical Reliability

Without ethical reliability, knowledge collapses into instrumental manipulation.

# 3. Civilizational Stability Theorem

See:

formal/08_CIVILIZATIONAL-STABILITY-THEOREM.md

Core Claim:

Civilization stability ⇔ Moral Integrity ∧ Justice Coherence ∧ Higher Accountability

# 5. Scope and Limitation

This framework:

• Does not reject empirical science  
• Extends ontology beyond material reduction  
• Integrates moral causality into structural analysis  
• Defines civilizational collapse condition formally  

---

# 6. Conclusion

If Moral Layer collapses → Civilization reduces to biological competition.

If Moral Layer dominates → Civilization stabilizes structurally.

The model therefore defines:

Ethical dominance as structural necessity, not theological preference.
