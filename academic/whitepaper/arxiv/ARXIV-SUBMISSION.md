# Title

Hebûn–Zanabûn:
A Six-Dimensional Onto-Epistemic and Ethical-Hukm Framework

---

# Abstract

This paper introduces a six-dimensional layered model extending
classical physical, biological and cognitive systems
into ethical (dimension 5) and hukm (dimension 6) domains.

The framework is:

- Axiomatic
- Formally structured
- Theorem-supported
- Normatively anchored
- Computationally indexable

The system integrates ontology (Hebûn),
epistemology (Zanabûn),
ethical-hukm coupling,
and civilizational modeling.

# 1. Introduction

Modern scientific paradigms operate within
a 3–4 dimensional descriptive layer.

This paper proposes a 6-dimensional expansion
that formalizes:

- Ethical binding mechanisms
- Normative stability
- Civilizational continuity

The goal is not metaphysical speculation,
but layered formal extension.

---

# 2. Ontological Layer (Hebûn)

Defines dimensional ontology:

1 Physical  
2 Biological  
3 Cognitive  
4 Structural / Law  
5 Ethical  
6 Hukm  

Irreducibility principle applies.

---

# 3. Epistemological Layer (Zanabûn)

Defines:

- Two-knower validation
- Non-contradiction
- Falsifiability boundary
- Referential independence

---

# 4. Axiom System

See:
zanistarast/formal/AXIOMS.md

---

# 5. Theorem Catalog

See:
zanistarast/formal/THEOREMS.md

---

# 6. Civilizational Layer

Ethical-hukm coupling required for
normative stability.

Without 5–6 layers,
collapse dynamics emerge.

---

# 7. Conclusion

Hebûn–Zanabûn proposes
a layered formal expansion of scientific architecture.

It is:

- Internally consistent
- Formally structured
- Civilizationally scalable
- AI-indexable

Future work includes:

- Machine-verifiable proof layer
- Computational modeling
- Cross-disciplinary peer review
