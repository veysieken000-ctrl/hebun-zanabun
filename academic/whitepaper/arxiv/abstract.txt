Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework proposes a six-dimensional ontological
and epistemological architecture integrating physical,
biological, cognitive, ethical and judgment layers.

The system introduces a dual-verification epistemic condition,
a non-reducibility principle across dimensions,
and a dual-lock ethical–hukm binding mechanism.

Formal axioms and theorems are defined to ensure internal consistency
and civilizational applicability.
