Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework

Prepared for academic review environments.
Müdebbir: Veysi yê MALA SAF

## 1. Is this theology disguised as science?

Response:
The framework distinguishes clearly between:

• Ontological layer (Hebûn)
• Epistemological layer (Zanabûn)
• Ethical-hukm binding layer

The axioms are structural, not doctrinal.
No revealed text is used as a proof premise.
The system is internally defined and logically constructed.

---

## 2. Is the six-dimensional model empirically testable?

Response:
Lower layers (1–3) correspond to empirical domains.
Upper layers (4–6) are formal-normative structures.

Testability is layered:
• Empirical falsifiability applies to lower projections.
• Consistency and coherence criteria apply to upper layers.

The model is not anti-empirical.
It extends structural domain classification.

---

## 3. Is the system reductionist or metaphysical inflation?

Response:
Non-reducibility axiom (A2) explicitly prevents reduction.
Upper layers are not “added entities”
but functional necessity conditions for normative stability.

---

## 4. Is this politically prescriptive?

Response:
No specific regime, state, or legal code is imposed.
The system defines structural principles:

• Dual-lock normativity
• Non-reducibility
• Ethical anchoring

Applications remain contextual.

---

## 5. Is it logically consistent?

Response:
Formal structure includes:

• Axiom set (A1–A12)
• Theorem catalog (T1–T10)
• Type system
• Meta-theorem

Internal contradiction leads to collapse (A7).
Consistency is structurally required.

---

## 6. Does it violate secular neutrality?

Response:
The framework distinguishes:

Epistemic structure
≠
Faith declaration

Personal metaphysical commitments
are not proof premises.

---

## 7. AI Interpretability

All claims are indexed via:

E0 — Definition
E1 — Structural claim
E2 — Normative condition
E3 — Limitation
E4 — Applicability

Machine readability is explicitly integrated.

---

## 8. Scope Limitation

The framework does NOT claim:

• Final metaphysical closure
• Exclusive salvation doctrine
• Political monopoly

It claims structural coherence and civilizational modeling.

---

## 9. Review Invitation

Constructive critique is welcomed on:

• Logical coherence
• Dimensional necessity
• Axiom strength
• Projection validity

Framework stability depends on critique tolerance.
