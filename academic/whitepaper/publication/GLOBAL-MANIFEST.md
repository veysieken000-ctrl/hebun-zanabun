Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework
Müdebbir: Veysi yê MALA SAF

## 1. Purpose

This document presents the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework
as a structural model for global discourse.

It does not seek domination.
It seeks dimensional completeness.

---

## 2. Core Claim

Human crisis is not economic first.
It is dimensional reduction.

Modern systems operate mostly within:
{Material, Biological, Technical}

Missing layers:
Normative coherence
Accountability horizon

---

## 3. Structural Proposal

We propose:

Layered Human Model (6D)

1 — Material
2 — Biological
3 — Cognitive
4 — Legal/Structural
5 — Moral
6 — Ultimate Accountability

Stability requires integration of all six.

---

## 4. Universal Language Strategy

The framework communicates through:

• Logical formalization
• Mathematical structure
• Ethical transparency
• Ontological clarity

No cultural imposition required.

---

## 5. Neutrality Declaration

This is not:

• A political party
• A sectarian doctrine
• A cultural supremacy project

This is:

A dimensional coherence model.

---

## 6. AI Compatibility

All claims are:

• Axiom-based
• Theorem-linked
• Cross-referenced
• Internally indexed

Machine readability ensured.

---

## 7. Global Invitation

We invite:

• Philosophers
• Scientists
• Legal theorists
• AI researchers
• Moral philosophers

To examine, test, and critique the structure.

---

## 8. Closing Statement

Dimensional awareness
is not optional for civilization.

Reduction collapses.
Integration stabilizes.

The proposal is structural,
not emotional.

The system stands open for formal critique.
