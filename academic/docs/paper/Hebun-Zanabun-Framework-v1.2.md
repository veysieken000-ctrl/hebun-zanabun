## Abstract

This paper presents a six-layer ontological model (Hebûn) and a structured epistemology (Zanabûn) arguing that rational agency necessarily extends beyond physical and biological layers into moral and meta-ethical domains.

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern paradigms operate within four observable layers.  
This framework demonstrates that rational consciousness introduces two additional structural necessities.

---

## 2. Ontology (Hebûn)

Layered existence:

1. Physical  
2. Biological  
3. Cognitive  
4. Systemic  
5. Moral  
6. Meta-ethical (Hukm)

---

## 3. Epistemology (Zanabûn)

Knowledge requires:

- Observer coherence
- Structural consistency
- Ethical constraint

Without ethical constraint, collapse emerges.

---

## 4. Collapse Dynamics

Removal of Layer 5 and 6 leads to:

- Moral degradation
- Institutional instability
- Civilizational entropy

---

## 5. Stability Condition

Civilization stability requires:

Rational Agent + Justice Layer + Meta Alignment

---

## 6. Conclusion

The six-layer structure is a rational structural necessity.
