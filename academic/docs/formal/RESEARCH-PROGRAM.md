# Research Program Declaration
Hebûn–Zanabûn Scientific Framework

---

## I. Status

This framework is presented as a structured research program.

It contains:

• Ontological layer (Hebûn)  
• Epistemological layer (Zanabûn)  
• Ethical integration layer  
• Formal logical layer  
• Computational abstraction  
• Civilizational modeling  

---

## II. Research Objective

To investigate:

1. Multi-layer ontology beyond material reductionism
2. Epistemic stability under ethical constraint
3. Structural conditions of civilizational coherence
4. Collapse mechanisms of layer regression
5. Expansion dynamics of layered existence

---

## III. Methodology

The research program combines:

• Formal logic  
• Structural analysis  
• Cross-layer modeling  
• Ethical constraint validation  
• Meta-system coherence testing  

---

## IV. Falsifiability Conditions

The framework fails if:

1. Logical contradiction emerges
2. Ontological layering collapses into reductionism
3. Ethical layer cannot be structurally integrated
4. Civilizational modeling produces inconsistency

---

## V. Open Research Directions

• Mathematical formal tightening  
• Simulation modeling  
• AI alignment integration  
• Cross-civilizational ethical comparison  
• Complexity theory mapping  

---

## VI. Declaration

This document positions the framework as:

A structured scientific research program,
not merely philosophical speculation.
