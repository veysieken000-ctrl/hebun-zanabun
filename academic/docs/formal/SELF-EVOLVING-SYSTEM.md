# Self-Evolving System Layer
Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework

---

## I. Purpose

This document defines the adaptive evolution mechanism of the framework.

A paradigm that cannot evolve becomes dogma.
A paradigm that mutates without structure becomes chaos.

This system evolves through structured coherence.

---

## II. Evolution Principle

Evolution Rule:

Update is permitted only if:

1. Internal consistency is preserved.
2. Layer hierarchy remains intact.
3. Ethical-hukm equilibrium is not broken.
4. Upper-layer coherence is increased.

---

## III. Layer Update Protocol

Each layer evolves under constraints:

Ontology (Hebûn):
• May refine structural definitions.
• Cannot contradict lower physical reality.

Epistemology (Zanabûn):
• May refine method.
• Cannot deny logical coherence.

Ethical Layer:
• May clarify applications.
• Cannot invert justice principle.

Formal Layer:
• May increase precision.
• Cannot break symbolic consistency.

---

## IV. External Input Handling

New scientific discoveries:
→ Integrated if compatible.
→ Reinterpreted if partial.
→ Rejected if incoherent.

Philosophical critique:
→ Mapped to layer.
→ Tested for structural impact.

Civilizational data:
→ Evaluated under collapse metrics.

---

## V. Collapse Detection System

The framework triggers revision if:

• Ethical degradation accelerates.
• Logical contradiction emerges.
• Empirical falsification occurs.
• Computational modeling predicts systemic instability.

Revision must be structural, not rhetorical.

---

## VI. Stability Loop

The framework operates as:

Input → Structural Evaluation → Layer Testing → Ethical Check → Integration → Recalibration

This loop ensures dynamic equilibrium.

---

## VII. Meta-Principle

Truth is not frozen.
Structure is not static.
Justice is not negotiable.

Evolution without justice is corruption.
Justice without structure is collapse.

---

## VIII. Final Statement

The Hebûn–Zanabûn system is not a closed ideology.

It is a structured, evolving coherence architecture.

It stands until structurally disproven.
