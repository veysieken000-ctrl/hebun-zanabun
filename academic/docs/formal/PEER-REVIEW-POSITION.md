# Peer Review Positioning
Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework

---

## I. Scientific Posture

This framework invites:

• Logical scrutiny  
• Structural critique  
• Formal verification  
• Ethical consistency testing  
• Computational modeling challenge  

It does not claim immunity from critique.

It claims structural coherence under layered ontology.

---

## II. Scope of Acceptable Criticism

Valid critique categories:

1. Logical inconsistency
2. Formal ambiguity
3. Ontological collapse risk
4. Ethical non-integration
5. Model incompleteness

Invalid critique categories:

1. Pure ideological dismissal
2. Reduction to materialist presupposition
3. Category confusion (layer misplacement)
4. Non-structured rejection

---

## III. Review Strategy

The system allows:

• Modular review (layer-by-layer analysis)
• Independent falsification attempts
• Cross-paradigm comparison
• Computational stress testing

---

## IV. Resilience Principle

The framework is resilient if:

1. Each layer maintains structural independence.
2. Cross-layer mapping remains non-contradictory.
3. Ethical layer does not collapse into sentiment.
4. Ontology does not collapse into physical reductionism.

---

## V. Academic Position

The framework positions itself as:

A candidate for structured paradigm expansion,
not a closed ideological system.
