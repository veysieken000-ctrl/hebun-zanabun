# Modal Logic Extension
## Hebûn–Zanabûn Formal Modal Layer

This document defines the modal structure of the 6D Ontological Framework.

---

## 1. Modal Operators

□P = Necessary (zorunlu varlık / hüküm)
◇P = Possible (imkân alanı)
ΔP = Ethical validation (ahlaki onay)
⊕P = Expansion of being
⊖P = Contraction of being
⊗ = Dimensional interaction operator
→ = Implication
↔ = Equivalence

---

## 2. Dimensional Mapping

D1 = Physical layer  
D2 = Biological layer  
D3 = Cognitive layer  
D4 = Normative law layer  
D5 = Ethical layer  
D6 = Judgment layer  

---

## 3. Core Ontological Axiom

□(D1 → D2 → D3 → D4 → D5 → D6)

Interpretation:
Higher dimensional layers necessarily presuppose lower layers.

---

## 4. Ethical Necessity Principle

□(ΔP → ⊕P)

If an action is ethically valid,
expansion of being is necessary.

---

## 5. Contraction Principle

□(¬ΔP → ⊖P)

If ethical validation fails,
contraction of being is necessary.

---

## 6. Judgment Closure

□(D5 ⊗ D6 → Final State)

Ethical layer interacting with judgment layer
produces ontological closure.

---

## 7. Second-Subject Condition

□(Knowledge → SecondSubjectVerification)

Truth requires dual-subject validation.

---

## 8. Meta-Level Constraint

□(Law ≠ HumanConstructionOnly)

Normative structure is not reducible to human agreement.
# Modal Logic Extension
## Hebûn–Zanabûn 6D Modal Structure

We define modal operators:

□ = Necessarily  
◇ = Possibly  
¬ = Negation  
→ = Implication  
∧ = Conjunction  

Let:

P(x) = Physical integrity  
B(x) = Biological coherence  
C(x) = Cognitive rationality  
N(x) = Normative alignment  
E(x) = Ethical alignment  
J(x) = Judgment state  
T(x) = Ontological expansion  

---

# Core Modal Axioms

1. □(P(x) → B(x))
   Physical collapse necessarily implies biological instability.

2. □(B(x) → C(x))
   Biological instability implies cognitive instability.

3. □(C(x) → N(x))
   Cognitive disorder destabilizes normative order.

4. □(N(x) → E(x))
   Normative misalignment destabilizes ethical state.

5. □(E(x) → J(x))
   Ethical state determines judgment state.

6. □(E(x) ∧ N(x) → T(x))
   Ethical and normative alignment necessarily lead to ontological expansion.

7. □(¬E(x) → ¬T(x))
   Ethical collapse prevents ontological expansion.

---

# Ontological Necessity Principle

□(E(x) → ◇T(x))

Ethical alignment makes expansion possible.

□(¬E(x) → ◇Collapse)

Ethical misalignment makes collapse possible.

---

# System Nature

The system is:

- Deterministic at structural level
- Open at ethical decision layer
- Modal necessity flows upward
- Collapse propagates downward

End of Modal Logic Extension.

System Status:
