# Civilizational Layer
## Zanistarast Civilizational Framework

This directory contains the civilizational architecture
of the Hebun–Zanabun project.

It defines a non-centralized, council-based,
fitrah-aligned civilizational model.

This is not a political manifesto.
It is an open-source civilizational framework.

Power concentration is structurally limited.

Human dignity, moral accountability,
epistemic verification, and fitrah alignment
form the invariant core.

Civilization here is coherence,
not coercion.
