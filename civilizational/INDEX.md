# Civilizational Layer

This directory contains the institutional implementation layer of the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework.

While:

- /core defines ontological–epistemological structure
- /constitution defines normative binding
- /paper contains academic articulation
- /whitepaper contains public narrative

The /civilizational layer defines applied structural design.
