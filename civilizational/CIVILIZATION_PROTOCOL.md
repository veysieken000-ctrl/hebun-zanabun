# Fitrah and Moral Age
## Civilizational Application Protocol

This document defines how the Zanistarast framework
may be applied by different cultures and societies.

It is not a political program.
It is an open civilizational methodology.

---

## Foundational Principle

Civilization is not imposed.
It emerges through moral coherence,
epistemic integrity,
and cultural autonomy.

No single culture owns this framework.

---

## Cultural Adaptation Rule

Each society may:

- Design its own council selection method
- Define its internal representation structure
- Determine procedural voting thresholds

However, no adaptation may violate:

- Human dignity
- Moral accountability
- Epistemic verification
- Fitrah alignment

---

## Rasterast Decision Method

Before implementation of major policies,
societies are encouraged to evaluate:

- Ontological clarity
- Verifiable knowledge base
- Moral consequence
- Ecosystem impact
- Power concentration risk

---

## Institutional Safeguards

Societies are encouraged to:

- Prevent concentration of authority
- Separate decision from execution
- Ensure transparent documentation
- Maintain periodic review mechanisms

---

## Evolution Principle

This protocol is not frozen.

Communities may refine and improve the model
as long as foundational principles remain intact.

Civilization is a living structure,
not a rigid template.
