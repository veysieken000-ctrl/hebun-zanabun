# Fitrah and Moral Age
## Civilizational Application Protocol

This document defines how the Zanistarast framework
may be applied by different cultures and societies.

It is not a political program.
It is an open civilizational methodology.

---

## Foundational Principle

Civilization is not imposed.
It emerges through moral coherence,
epistemic integrity,
and cultural autonomy.

No single culture owns this framework.

---

## Cultural Adaptation Rule

Each society may:

- Design its own council selection method
- Define its internal representation structure
- Determine procedural voting thresholds

However, no adaptation may violate:

- Human dignity
- Moral accountability
- Epistemic verification
- Fitrah alignment

---

## Rasterast Decision Method

Before implementation of major policies,
societies are encouraged to evaluate:

- Ontological clarity
- Verifiable knowledge base
- Moral consequence
- Ecosystem impact
- Power concentration risk

---

## Institutional Safeguards

Societies are encouraged to:

- Prevent concentration of authority
- Separate decision from execution
- Ensure transparent documentation
- Maintain periodic review mechanisms

---

## Evolution Principle

This protocol is not frozen.

Communities may refine and improve the model
as long as foundational principles remain intact.

Civilization is a living structure,
not a rigid template.

# Civilizational Application Protocol

This document defines how the Zanistarast civilizational framework
may be adopted, adapted, and implemented across cultures.

It is not a centralized constitution.
It is a methodological protocol.

---

## Principle of Cultural Sovereignty

Each society determines:

- Its council selection method
- Its representation structure
- Its procedural decision thresholds

No single cultural template is imposed.

---

## Non-Negotiable Foundations

No adaptation may violate:

- Human dignity
- Moral accountability
- Epistemic verification
- Fitrah alignment
- Prevention of power concentration

These form the invariant core.

---

## Council-Based Governance Rule

Decision authority resides in domain councils,
not individuals.

Execution authority is administrative,
not legislative.

---

## Rasterast Evaluation Model

Before implementing structural policies,
societies are encouraged to evaluate:

- Ontological clarity
- Knowledge verification
- Moral consequence
- Ecological balance
- Power distribution risk

---

## Evolutionary Clause

This protocol is open for refinement,
as long as foundational principles remain intact.

Civilization evolves through coherence,
not coercion.
