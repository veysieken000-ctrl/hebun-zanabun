Version: V2  
Status: Civilizational Layer Activated  
Release Type: Structural Declaration

## 1. What This Is

Hebûn–Zanabûn is not a political movement.

It is not a reactionary ideology.

It is a structured civilizational framework grounded in:

- Ontological coherence  
- Epistemic responsibility  
- Moral constraint  
- Institutional stability  

It proposes a dignity-centered order instead of a power-centered system.

---

## 2. The Diagnosis

Modern civilization suffers from:

- Moral fragmentation  
- Institutional distrust  
- Information distortion  
- Power concentration without ethical binding  

Technology has advanced.
Conscience has not.

This structural asymmetry generates collapse dynamics.

---

## 3. The Proposal

We propose a six-layer civilizational architecture:

1. Physical  
2. Biological  
3. Cognitive  
4. Systemic  
5. Moral  
6. Meta-ethical (Judgment Layer)

Stability requires activation of Layers 5 and 6.

Without moral and meta-ethical integration,
systems inevitably degrade.

---

## 4. The Civilizational Commitment

We affirm:

- Human dignity is structural, not optional.
- Truth requires verification and responsibility.
- Justice is a systemic requirement.
- Power must remain morally bound.
- Diversity is not fragmentation but structured plurality.

---

## 5. The Call

This declaration invites:

- Scholars  
- Ethical technologists  
- Institutional reformers  
- Cultural thinkers  
- Civilizational researchers  

To evaluate, critique, expand, and refine the framework.

This is not a closed doctrine.
It is an open structural architecture.
