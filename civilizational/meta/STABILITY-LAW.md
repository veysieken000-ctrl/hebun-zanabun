# STABILITY LAW — Civilizational Stability Framework

## Purpose

This document defines the structural stability conditions
of the Hebûn–Zanabûn system at the civilizational layer.

A system that cannot define its collapse condition
cannot claim historical durability.

## Law 1 — Dimensional Reduction Collapse

If a society reduces itself to lower layers only (D ≤ 2):

• Meaning loss  
• Normative instability  
• Internal contradiction  
• Structural fragmentation  

Result: Collapse dynamics begin.

---

## Law 2 — Dual Lock Requirement

Binding civilization requires:

Ahlak ★ Hüküm

If one is missing:

• Ahlak without Hüküm → chaos  
• Hüküm without Ahlak → authoritarian rigidity  

Stability requires dual integration.

---

## Law 3 — Hak-Centered Anchoring

If center = power → decay  
If center = personality → cult instability  
If center = Hak → structural continuity  

---

## Law 4 — Two-Knower Validation

Single-source truth → dogma  
Dual validation → epistemic resilience  

---

## Conclusion

A civilization survives if:

• All 6 dimensions remain integrated  
• Dual lock is preserved  
• Hak remains central  
• Collapse equation is known and prevented
