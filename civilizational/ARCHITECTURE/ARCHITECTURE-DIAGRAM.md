## Authority Flow

Knowledge → Council Deliberation → Upper Review → Execution → Public Transparency

No individual authority overrides council structure.

## Stability Safeguards

- Power separation
- Transparency
- Periodic renewal
- Moral accountability
- Epistemic verification

---

## Core Invariants

The following principles cannot be overridden:

- Human dignity
- Moral responsibility
- Fitrah alignment
- Prevention of power concentration
- Verifiable knowledge requirement

---

Civilization is structured coherence.
Not centralized dominance.
