# Newroza Kawa Civilizational Manifest

## Declaration of Direction

Newroza Kawa Civilization represents a fıtrat-aligned,  
morally grounded, and structurally stable civilizational vision.

It is not built on domination,  
but on alignment with natural law and moral coherence.

---

## Foundational Axis

This civilization stands on:

- Hebûn (Ontological Grounding)
- Zanabûn (Epistemological Verification)
- Mabûn (Economic Equilibrium)
- Hebûn Governance Model (Council Architecture)
- Rasterast (Correct Reading Method)

---

## Moral Core

The highest authority in this model is not power,
but moral coherence.

No institution may claim absolute authority.

Moral legitimacy precedes structural authority.

---

## Civilizational Goal

The aim is:

- Preservation of existence
- Expansion of just order
- Long-term structural continuity
- Moral elevation of human society

---

## Civilizational Warning

If moral guardianship collapses,
structural power becomes corruption.

If governance overrides morality,
the system decays from within.
