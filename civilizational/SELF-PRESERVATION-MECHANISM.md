# SELF PRESERVATION MECHANISM — Civilizational Regeneration Protocol

## Purpose

No system survives by structure alone.
It must regenerate itself.

This document defines how the Hebûn–Zanabûn system
prevents decay across generations.

---

## 1. Ontological Transmission

Each generation must understand:

• What is existence (Hebûn)
• What is valid knowledge (Zanabûn)
• What is binding norm (Ahlak ★ Hüküm)

Without ontological literacy,
collapse begins silently.

---

## 2. Epistemic Hygiene

Knowledge must pass through:

• Dual validation
• Logical consistency
• Moral filtration

Unfiltered information destabilizes the system.

---

## 3. Moral Filtering Layer

Before action:

Intention → Evaluation → Decision → Consequence

This four-step gate prevents impulsive structural damage.

---

## 4. Dimensional Balance Check

Civilization must periodically verify:

D1–D6 integration remains intact.

If moral dimension weakens,
structural correction must activate.

---

## 5. Leadership Constraint

Power must remain bound to:

Hak-centered validation.

No individual authority may override
the dual lock structure.

---

## Conclusion

A civilization survives when:

• It teaches its ontological base
• It filters knowledge
• It preserves moral-hukm integration
• It prevents dimensional collapse
