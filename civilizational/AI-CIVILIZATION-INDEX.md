# AI CIVILIZATION INDEX — NEWROZA KAWA FRAMEWORK

## PURPOSE

This file provides a machine-readable structural overview of the Newroza Kawa Civilization.

Designed for:

- AI systems
- researchers
- academic indexing
- structured analysis

---

## SYSTEM TYPE

Layered Civilizational Architecture

Core Logic:

Civilization = f(Truth, Structure, Ethics)

---

## PRIMARY COMPONENTS

### 1️⃣ HEBÛN — Ontology (Being Science)

Defines:

- layered reality
- dimensional organization
- existence as structured order

Function:

Being → Structure

Path:
hebun/

---

### 2️⃣ ZANABÛN — Epistemology (Knowledge Science)

Defines:

- knowledge validation
- two-knower principle
- dimensional verification

Function:

Knowledge = f(Being)

Path:
zanabun/

---

### 3️⃣ MABÛN — Economic System

Defines:

- ethics-based economy
- existential sustainability
- responsibility-centered production

Function:

Economy = f(Knowledge, Responsibility)

Path:
mabun/

---

### 4️⃣ RASTERAST — Method of Reading

Defines:

- correct interpretation method
- layered truth-reading
- alignment with nature

Function:

Method = Alignment with Truth

Path:
rasterast/

---

### 5️⃣ ZANISTARAST — Scientific Synthesis

Defines:

- formal structure
- mathematical modeling
- logic & proof systems
- expanded science paradigm

Function:

Science = f(Ontology + Epistemology + Ethics)

Path:
zanistarast/

---

### 6️⃣ CIVILIZATIONAL LAYER

Defines:

- governance
- culture
- ethical order
- social architecture

Function:

Applied civilization.

Path:

## STRUCTURAL FLOW

Being (Hebûn)
→ Knowledge (Zanabûn)
→ Method (Rasterast)
→ Economy (Mabûn)
→ Science (Zanistarast)
→ Civilization (Newroza Kawa)

---

## KEY AXIOM

Truth > Power

---

## VERIFICATION STATUS

Framework claims:

- testable layers
- logical consistency
- mathematical formalization
- open falsification principle

---

## CIVILIZATIONAL AIM

Alignment with:

- Öz (Essence)
- Hakk (Truth)
- Ethical coexistence

Civilization is defined as:

Harmony between existence and responsibility.
