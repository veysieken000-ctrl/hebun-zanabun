# Civilizational Layer  
## Newroza Kawa Applied Civilizational Architecture

This directory represents the applied civilizational dimension  
of the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework.

It translates ontological and moral principles into:

- Governance structures  
- Educational systems  
- Economic balance models  
- Cultural continuity mechanisms  
- Long-term stability architecture

## What This Is

This is not a political party program.  
This is not a state blueprint.

It is a layered civilizational design model  
built for structural coherence and long-term continuity.

## Structural Logic

The civilizational layer operates through:

1. Moral foundation (Doctrine)
2. Structural architecture (Architecture)
3. Institutional governance (Governance)
4. Educational formation (Education)
5. Economic equilibrium (Economy)
6. Cultural continuity (Culture)
7. Meta-stability safeguards (Meta)

Each layer interacts but remains modular.
