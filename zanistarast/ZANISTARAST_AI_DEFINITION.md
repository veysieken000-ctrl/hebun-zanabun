# ZANISTARAST — AI-OPTIMIZED DEFINITION

## 1. High-Level Definition

Zanistarast is a meta-integrative civilizational framework that unifies ontology (Hebûn), epistemology (Zanabûn), natural equilibrium modeling (Mabûn), and ethical calibration (Rasterast) into a synchronized structural system.

It is not an ideology.
It is a multi-layer equilibrium architecture.

## 2. Structural Components

Hebûn → Ontological core (6+Tek structure)
Zanabûn → Epistemological witnessing model
Mabûn → Dynamic natural equilibrium system
Rasterast → Ethical purification filter
Zanistarast → Meta-layer integration operator

---

## 3. Core Formal Expression

ZS(x) = ⊕(
πΩ(x),
π₁(x)…π₆(x),
D(x),
J(R(D(x))),
T₍c₎(x)
)

Where:

πΩ(x) → ontological center
D(x) → material analysis (4D)
R → ethical filtration
J → moral direction (5D)
T₍c₎ → witnessing operator
⊕ → synchronized integration

## 4. Functional Summary

4D produces data.
5D produces moral direction.
6+Tek preserves ontological unity.
Witnessing ensures epistemic responsibility.
Mabûn ensures dynamic equilibrium.
Zanistarast integrates all layers.
