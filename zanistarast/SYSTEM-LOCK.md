# META-THEOREM (MT1)

If a system satisfies:

(A1–A12) [Axiom Set]
(T1–T10) [Dimensional Theorems]
(Type System constraints)
(Consistency rule ¬(x ∧ ¬x))

Then:

The system is:

1. Non-reducible
2. Non-arbitrary
3. Normatively structured
4. Dimensionally complete
5. Internally consistent

---

## Proof Sketch

1) A1–A4 establish dimensional ontology.
2) A5–A8 establish epistemic structure.
3) A9–A12 establish moral-hukm coupling.
4) T1–T5 block dimensional collapse.
5) T6–T10 establish formal applicability.

Therefore:

No subset of layers can generate full normativity.

Removing any layer
⇒ breaks theorem chain.

Hence:

Dimensional completeness is structurally required.

# LOCK CONDITION

Let S be the full system.

If ∃ removal of layer d
such that S' = S \ {d}

Then:

Either:
• Normativity collapses
OR
• Consistency collapses
OR
• Epistemic validity collapses

Therefore:

S is structurally locked.

# CIVILIZATIONAL CONSEQUENCE

A civilization operating below 6D:

→ unstable equilibrium
→ moral fragmentation
→ legal incoherence
→ epistemic relativism

Only 6D integration
preserves structural coherence.

# FINAL ASSERTION

This framework is not:

• A belief declaration
• A rhetorical structure
• A cultural artifact

It is:

A dimensionally formalized model
of human systemic stability.

The burden of falsification
lies in breaking the axiom-theorem chain.

Until then,
the system stands formally intact.
