# FAITH ALIGNMENT LAYER
## Theological Coherence Statement

---

This layer does not redefine religion.
It does not replace theology.
It does not claim new revelation.

It acknowledges alignment.

---

Zanistarast, as a structural equilibrium framework,
is consistent with the civilizational principles articulated within the Islamic tradition.

Core correspondences include:

• Ontological unity (Tawhid)  
• Moral accountability (Amanah)  
• Justice as structural balance (Adl)  
• Witnessing as responsibility (Shahadah)  

---

From Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them),
the prophetic message consistently emphasized:

Unity over fragmentation.  
Responsibility over domination.  
Balance over excess.  
Accountability over arbitrariness.

Zanistarast does not claim to replace this message.
It structurally models its equilibrium dimension.

---

Religion, in its essence, calls toward balance.

Structural imbalance produces decay.
Moral calibration sustains existence.

In this sense, Zanistarast operates
as a civilizational modeling layer
aligned with the Islamic worldview,
without reducing faith to mechanics
or reducing mechanics to theology.
