# Proof — MT1
## 3→4 Structural Necessity

### Claim
Layer 3 (Mind) cannot sustain order without Layer 4 (Law/Spirit + Execution).

---

### Definitions

Sustainable Order:
A system that preserves existence (A9)
and enables expansion (A10)
under consistency (A7).

Layer 3:
Decision and interpretation mechanism.

Layer 4:
Binding law structure + operational enforcement.

---

### Used Axioms
A1 — Layer existence
A3 — Cross-layer projection
A7 — Consistency requirement
A9 — Preservation principle
A10 — Expansion principle
A12 — Dual-lock binding

---

### Proof

1) Mind (Layer 3) produces decisions.

2) Decisions without binding structure are unstable.
   Different minds → different outputs.
   → Violates systemic consistency (A7).

3) Sustainable existence requires preservation and expansion (A9, A10).

4) Preservation and expansion require stable binding law.

5) Stable binding law belongs to Layer 4.

Therefore:

Without Layer 4,
Layer 3 cannot sustain systemic order.
