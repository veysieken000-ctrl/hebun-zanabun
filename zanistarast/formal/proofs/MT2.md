# Proof — MT2
## 4→5 Normative Necessity

### Claim
Layer 4 (Law/Spirit + Execution)
cannot generate binding moral meaning
without Layer 5 (Ethical consciousness).

---

### Definitions

Layer 4:
Operational law structure.
System coordination.
Execution mechanism.

Layer 5:
Normative awareness.
Moral responsibility.
Intentional evaluation.

Binding Norm:
A rule that is not only enforced,
but consciously owned.

---

### Used Axioms
A2 — Non-reducibility
A7 — Consistency
A9 — Preservation
A10 — Expansion
A11 — Moral filter axiom
A12 — Dual lock principle

---

### Proof

1) Law (Layer 4) regulates structure.

2) Regulation alone does not equal moral ownership.

3) A rule can be enforced
   without being ethically internalized.

4) Ethical internalization requires moral consciousness (Layer 5).

5) Normative binding requires (Knowledge ⊗ Value). (A11)

6) Layer 4 alone cannot satisfy A11.

Therefore:

Layer 4 cannot produce binding ethical order
without Layer 5.
