# Proof — MT3
## 5→6 Judgment Completion Principle

### Claim
Layer 5 (Ethics) alone
cannot complete normative order
without Layer 6 (Final Judgment).

---

### Definitions

Layer 5:
Ethical awareness.
Intentional moral action.
Value-oriented decision.

Layer 6:
Final binding judgment.
Ultimate accountability.
Non-relative closure.

Normative Completion:
A moral system that is not left suspended,
but reaches decisive closure.

---

### Used Axioms
A2 — Non-reducibility
A7 — Consistency
A11 — Moral filter axiom
A12 — Dual lock principle

---

### Proof

1) Ethical awareness (Layer 5) produces moral intent.

2) Intent without final adjudication
   remains conditionally suspended.

3) A norm that can remain unjudged
   is not fully binding.

4) Binding structure requires final closure. (A12)

5) Closure requires judgment dimension (Layer 6).

Therefore:

Layer 5 cannot complete normative architecture
without Layer 6.
