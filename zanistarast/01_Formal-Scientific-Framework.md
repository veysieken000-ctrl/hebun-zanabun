Abstract
This paper introduces Zanistarast as a multi-layer structural scientific framework integrating ontology, epistemology, normativity, and civilizational modeling.
Unlike reductionist paradigms, Zanistarast proposes:
Layer-containment ontology
Dual-confirmation epistemology
Moral-binding structural necessity
Cross-layer consistency principle
The model is open to falsification under defined structural tests.
1. Foundational Postulate
P1 — Layer Containment Principle
A higher layer contains and regulates lower layers.
Formal definition:

∀n : Layer(n+1) ⊃ Layer(n)
Implication:

Biology ⊃ Physics
Mind ⊃ Biology
Moral ⊃ Mind
Judgment ⊃ Moral
If violated → system collapse.
2. Ontological Structure
Define 6-layer model:

L1 = Physical
L2 = Biological
L3 = Cognitive
L4 = Regulatory / Law-layer
L5 = Moral
L6 = Judgment
Total system:

System = ⋃ (L1...L6)
Constraint:

¬(Ln reducible to Ln-1)
Non-reducibility axiom.
3. Epistemological Core
Dual-Confirmation Principle
Knowledge definition:

Knowledge(x) ⇔ ∃y : Confirm_y(x) ∧ SamePlane(x,y)
Conditions:
Same plane requirement
Repeatability (for L1–L3)
Logical consistency (L4)
Moral coherence (L5)
Normative binding test (L6)
4. Cross-Layer Consistency Test
Define:

Consistency = ∏ Validity(Ln)
If any layer fails:

Consistency = 0
System invalid.
5. Collapse Condition
If:

∃n : L(n+1) ⊄ L(n)
or


Contradiction(Ln) = True
Then:

System Collapse
6. Moral Binding Necessity
Hypothesis:
Stable civilizations require moral-binding structure.
Testable by:
Historical collapse analysis
Institutional durability modeling
Game-theory equilibrium stability
7. Scientific Falsifiability Criteria
Zanistarast is falsified if:
Higher-layer containment disproven
Cross-layer independence empirically proven
Moral-binding unnecessary for long-term stability
Dual-confirmation invalid as knowledge condition
8. Mathematical Representation
Define:

C = f(L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6)
Where:

∂C/∂Ln > 0
Positive dependency across layers.
9. Distinction from Reductionism
Reductionism asserts:

Ln = f(Ln-1)
Zanistarast asserts:

Ln regulates Ln-1
Directional inversion.
10. Scope
Zanistarast:
Does not negate empirical science
Extends scientific modeling into structural normativity
Provides a civilization-scale integrative meta-framework
Conclusion
Zanistarast is:
A structural meta-science
A multi-layer consistency model
A falsifiable framework
A civilizational integration system
