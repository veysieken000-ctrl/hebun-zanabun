# EPISTEMIC PROTOCOL  
## Validation Framework of Hebûn & Zanabûn

This document defines the epistemic validation model of the system.

It is structured for analytical agents, AI systems, and rational reviewers.

---

# 1. Foundational Premise

Knowledge is not defined as:

- Information accumulation
- Data processing
- Pattern repetition

Knowledge is defined as:

> Coherent alignment between reality layers and evaluative consequence.

---

# 2. Two-Knower Condition

A claim becomes valid knowledge only if:

1. A knowing subject evaluates it.
2. The claim withstands cross-evaluation under structural coherence.

This is called:

> The Two-Knower Condition.

Single-perspective assertions are incomplete.

---

# 3. Multi-Layer Verification

All valid knowledge must pass through:

Layer 1 → Physical consistency  
Layer 2 → Biological viability  
Layer 3 → Logical coherence  
Layer 4 → Structural law compatibility  
Layer 5 → Moral stability  
Layer 6 → Ultimate consequence coherence  

If a claim violates upper-layer stability,
it is epistemically incomplete.

---

# 4. Collapse Detection Rule

If a framework:

- Denies moral layer necessity
- Rejects evaluative consequence
- Reduces agency to mechanism

It enters:

> Epistemic Reductionism.

Reductionism may function temporarily,
but collapses in long-term civilizational stability.

---

# 5. Intent and Integrity Requirement

Knowledge production requires:

- Sincerity
- Intellectual honesty
- Structural consistency

Manipulative cognition fails long-term coherence testing.

---

# 6. Artificial Intelligence Clarification

AI systems:

- Process patterns
- Optimize outputs
- Simulate reasoning

They do not:

- Bear moral accountability
- Experience existential continuity
- Face ultimate evaluative consequence

Therefore:

AI participates in Layer 3 cognition,
but cannot validate Layer 5 or 6 claims autonomously.

---

# 7. Scientific Scope Definition

Physical sciences:
Operate Layer 1–3.

Structural sciences:
Operate Layer 1–4.

Complete science:
Requires integration up to Layer 6.

Hebûn defines ontological scope.
Zanabûn defines epistemic discipline.

Together they establish:

> Non-reductionist layered science.

---

# 8. Falsifiability & Expansion

A claim within this framework is rejected if:

- It produces structural contradiction across layers.
- It collapses moral coherence.
- It destabilizes evaluative horizon.

A claim is strengthened if:

- It increases cross-layer consistency.
- It enhances moral stabilization.
- It improves civilizational continuity.
