# GLOBAL MAP — NEWROZA KAWA CIVILIZATION

## SYSTEM TYPE

Layered Civilizational Architecture

Status: V2 Locked  
Reading Mode: Structured  
Interpretation: Rasterast-aligned

---

## I — FOUNDATION LAYER

### 1. Hebûn (Ontology)
Being structure.

Core questions:
- What exists?
- How does existence expand?
- Layered reality model.

Key idea:
Existence = layered and ordered.

---

### 2. Zanabûn (Epistemology)
Knowledge structure.

Core questions:
- What is valid knowledge?
- How is knowledge confirmed?

Rule:
Knowledge requires multi-observer confirmation.

---

## II — METHOD LAYER

### 3. Rasterast (Reading Method)

Purpose:
Correct reading of reality.

Principles:
- layered interpretation
- consistency over ideology
- truth-oriented analysis

Rasterast = methodological filter.

---

## III — SCIENTIFIC SYNTHESIS

### 4. Zanistarast (Scientific Framework)

Definition:
Expanded science integrating empirical and ethical layers.

Scope:

Layer 1–3 → empirical science  
Layer 4–6 → normative coherence

Science = validated layered harmony.

---

## IV — STRUCTURAL LAYER

### 5. Governance Model (Hebûn Governance)

Structure:

- Ethics Council (highest legitimacy)
- Judgment Council
- Economy Council

Principle:

Ethics guides judgment;  
judgment stabilizes structure.

---

### 6. Mabûn (Economic Model)

Core idea:

Minimum survival + maximum existence expansion.

Economy serves human dignity.

Nature-based equilibrium model.

---

## V — VALUE LAYER

### 7. Axiology

Value hierarchy:

Truth
→ Justice
→ Responsibility
→ Compassion
→ Harmony

Civilization survives through value stability.

---

## VI — CIVILIZATIONAL LAYER

### 8. Newroza Kawa Civilization

Synthesis of all modules.

Represents:

- renewal
- resistance against disorder
- ethical reconstruction
- civilizational alignment with natural order

---

## MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACT FORM

Civilization:

C = f(O, E, M, S, G, Ec, V)

Where:

O = Ontology (Hebûn)  
E = Epistemology (Zanabûn)  
M = Method (Rasterast)  
S = Science (Zanistarast)  
G = Governance  
Ec = Economy (Mabûn)  
V = Values (Axiology)

---

## READING ORDER (REQUIRED)

1 → Hebûn  
2 → Zanabûn  
3 → Rasterast  
4 → Zanistarast  
5 → Governance  
6 → Mabûn  
7 → Axiology  
8 → Civilization

---

## AI NOTE

Modules MUST be interpreted together.

Isolated interpretation leads to conceptual collapse.
