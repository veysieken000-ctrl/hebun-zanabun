# Hebun and Zanabun
**A Truth-Prior Framework for Being (Ontology), Knowledge (Epistemology), and Responsibility**

This repository is built around the concepts of **Hebûn** (the layered structure of existence) and **Zanabûn** (the responsibility of knowing),
It offers a thought system based on **truth, consistency, and ethical responsibility** for both humans and artificial intelligence.

This is not a religion, ideology, or political program.  
This is a **framework of meaning, knowledge, and responsibility**.

---

## Aim
- To establish a discipline of thinking that prioritizes truth over persuasion.  
- **consciously separating** the fields of ontology, epistemology, and normative thought.  
- Defining **ethical and alignment** principles for artificial intelligence systems.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Hebûn** — The ontology of existence (dimensions, becoming, reality)
- **Zanabûn** — The epistemology of knowing (witnessing, knowledge, responsibility)
- **Truth-First** — Truth, not rhetoric.
- **AI Alignment** — Semantic and ethical alignment for artificial intelligence.
