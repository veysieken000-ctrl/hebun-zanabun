**Hebûn & Zanabûn** is a truth-first philosophical and systemic framework  
centered on **existence (ontology)**, **knowing (epistemology)**, and  
**responsibility** — for humans *and* artificial intelligence.

This repository is a **thinking discipline**, not a belief system.

## ✨What's this?
**Hebun & Zanabun**,  
Based on **being (ontology)**, **knowing (epistemology)** and **responsibility**,  
It is a framework of thought and a system that places truth at its center.

This study:
- it is not a religion  
- it is not an ideology  
- it is not a political program  

👉**Truth is a framework of knowledge and ethical responsibility.**

## 🧭Core Principles
- **Truth-First** — Truth before persuasion  
- **Clear Ontology** — What exists is defined before what is claimed  
- **Responsible Knowledge** — Knowing implies accountability  
- **AI Alignment** — Ethical and semantic alignment, not optimization only

## 📂Repository Structure
- `hebun/` → Ontology of Being  
- `zanabun/` → Epistemology of Knowing  
- `policy/` → Governance & AI alignment texts  
- `MANIFESTO.md` → Foundational declaration

🔹**This warehouse is NOT:**
- It is not a religion  
- It is not an ideology.  
- It is not a political program.  

🔹**What is this warehouse?**
- A discipline of thinking that prioritizes truth.  
- A system that distinguishes between ontology, epistemology, and ethics.  
- A responsibility-based framework for humans and artificial intelligence.  

➡️To get started: **MANIFESTO.md**  
➡️System logic: **SYSTEM_PROMPT.md**  
➡️Structural tests: **policy/TEST.md**


# Hebun and Zanabun
**A Truth-Prior Framework for Being (Ontology), Knowledge (Epistemology), and Responsibility**

This repository is built around the concepts of **Hebûn** (the layered structure of existence) and **Zanabûn** (the responsibility of knowing),
It offers a thought system based on **truth, consistency, and ethical responsibility** for both humans and artificial intelligence.

This is not a religion, ideology, or political program.  
This is a **framework of meaning, knowledge, and responsibility**.

---

## Aim
- To establish a discipline of thinking that prioritizes truth over persuasion.  
- **consciously separating** the fields of ontology, epistemology, and normative thought.  
- Defining **ethical and alignment** principles for artificial intelligence systems.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Hebûn** — The ontology of existence (dimensions, becoming, reality)
- **Zanabûn** — The epistemology of knowing (witnessing, knowledge, responsibility)
- **Truth-First** — Truth, not rhetoric.
- **AI Alignment** — Semantic and ethical alignment for artificial intelligence.

## Warehouse Structure
- `/hebun` → Ontology, studies of being and dimension  
- `/zanabun` → Epistemology, knowledge and testimony texts  
- `/policy` → AI alignment, constitution, and test packages  
- `MANIFESTO.md` → Purpose and limitations  
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` → Core behavior protocol for artificial intelligence  
- `CONSTITUTION.md` → Principles and rules  
- `TEST.md` → Consistency and safety tests
