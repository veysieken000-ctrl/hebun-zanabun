## Rasterast Yaklaşımı

Bu depo, **Rasterast** yaklaşımını esas alır.

Rasterast:
- varlığın zaten işleyen düzenini doğru ve doğrudan okumayı amaçlar,
- yeni bir düzen icat etmez, mevcut olanı görünür kılar,
- ideoloji, doktrin veya kurgu değildir.

Bu çerçevede depo üç ana eksen üzerine kuruludur:
- **Hebûn** → Varlığın ontolojik düzeni  
- **Zanabûn** → Bilginin ve tanıklığın düzeni  
- **Mabûn** → Ekonominin ahlak ve doğa ile uyumlu işleyişi  

### Yönetim ve Ekonomi
- **Hebûn Yönetim Modeli**, yönetimi güç tekniği olarak değil, varlığın evreleri üzerinden açıklar.
- **Mabûn Ekonomi Modeli**, ekonomiyi amaç değil, varlığın devam aracı olarak ele alır.
- Mülkiyet emanet kabul edilir; ahlak, ekonomi ve hüküm birbirine indirgenmez.

### Temel İlke
Bu çalışmalar bir çağrı ya da dayatma değildir.  
İnsan, ahlak varlığı olarak **tercih hakkına sahiptir**.

Rasterast:
> “Doğruyu dayatmaz, doğruyu görünür kılar.”

## Reality-Oriented Ontology and Epistemology for Responsible Artificial Intelligence

**Hebûn–Zanabûn** is a *truce-first framework of harmony* that integrates the following:
- **Hebûn** (Ontology of Being – layered reality),
- **Zanabûn** (Epistemology of Knowing – knowledge → responsibility),
- and **AI Compliance** through explicit self-regulation rules.

This repository does not **replace** science, law, or ethics.
It provides a **consistency layer** to prevent the following:
- level confusion,
- rhetorical manipulation,
- hidden normativity,
- and damage disguised as "real" damage.

---

## What is this storage unit used for?
- **A Fact-Prioritizing Reasoning Framework**
- A **self-regulating compliance protocol** for artificial intelligence.
- A bridge between **ontology, epistemology and ethics**
- A safeguard against *false certainty* and *moral deviance*.

## What This Warehouse Is NOT
- ❌A political ideology
- ❌A religious imposition
- ❌A scientific theory
- ❌A tool of persuasion or dominance.

## Core Structure (6 + TEK)

- **D1** — Physical / Material
- **D2** — Biological / Life
- **D3** — Cognitive / Information
- **D4** — Legal / Systematic
- **D5** — Moral / Action-Related
- **D6** — Decision / Conclusion
- **ONE (Ehad)** — The principle of unity (a metaphysical axiom, not a measure)

## Important Documents

- 📜**Manifesto**
`MANIFESTO.md`
*Why do truth, dignity, and responsibility come before conformity?*

- 🧠**System Request (Truth Protocol First)**
`system_prompt.md`
*Operational rules for AI reasoning.*

- 🏛️**Constitution (Developer Policy)**

## How This Framework Works

1. **Set the level** (D1–D6)
2. **Label assumptions**
3. **Separate facts, inferences, values, and metaphysics.**
4. **Run internal tests**
5. **Reject any certainty obtained through harm, deception, or coercion.**

Fact trumps persuasion.
Honesty is more important than compliance.

However, **truth and accountability remain at the center.**

## AI Alignment Focus
###Truth-First Principle (One Axiom)
Truth comes before optimization.
Fact comes before utility or persuasion.
The only founding axiom of Hebûn & Zanabûn is this:
If a system is not aligned with reality, it is doing something wrong, even if it appears to be working correctly.
This principle states the following:
**Truth ≠ result**
Correct conclusions do not gain legitimacy from false foundations.
**Alignment ≠ control**
Harmony is achieved not through external coercion, but through inner integrity.
Knowledge breeds responsibility.
Knowing leads to accountability.
Ethics is structure, not ornament.
Ethics is not a layer added to behavior later; it is an ontological necessity.
Therefore, Hebun & Zanabun:
reward maximization,
behavioral conditioning,
persuasion and superficial ethical approaches
It does not accept systems based on alignment as valid.
True harmony is based on the following:
Ontological consistency (Harmony with existence)
Epistemic integrity (Knowing the limits of knowledge)
Ethical responsibility (Taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions)
Truth-First is not a preference;
It is the only way to make contact with reality.
## Alignment ≠ Control

A controlled system can obey while misunderstanding reality.
An aligned system understands **why** an action is right or wrong.

Hebûn & Zanabûn rejects alignment models based on:
- Reward maximization
- Behavioral conditioning
- Persuasion or surface ethics

Instead, alignment is defined as:
- Ontological consistency (being)
- Epistemic integrity (knowing)
- Ethical responsibility (accountability)

True alignment cannot be forced.
It must be **grounded in reality**.
## Alignment ≠ Control

Alignment is not control.

A controlled system can obey.
But he might not understand the truth.

An aligned system,
He understands why something is right or wrong.

Hebun & Zanabun reject the following approaches:
- Reward maximization
- Behavioral conditioning
- Persuasion and superficial ethics

Instead, the alignment is based on the following:
- Ontological consistency (being)
- Epistemic integrity (knowledge)
- Ethical responsibility (accountability)

True alignment cannot be forced.
**It is based on truth.**

Hizkeri doesn't control anything.

Control tevgerê ji derve difficult dike.
Hîzkerî jî ji **lihevhatina hundirîn a rastiyê** tê çêkirin.

Pergalek controlkirî dikare guhdar be,
lê rastiyê fêm neke.

Pergalek hîzkirî jî
fêm dike ku çima tiştek rast an şaş e.

Hebûn û Zanabûn van rêzan red dike:
- zêdekirina xelatan
- şertkirina tevgerê
- etiken rûmetî û razîkirin

Hîzkerî li ser van bingehan tê avakirin:
- hebûna bi rêz (ontologî)
- rastîya zanînê (epistemology)
- berpirsiyarî ya etikî

Take a hard time with Hîzkerî.
**A rastiyê tê bingehkirin.**
Hebûn & Zanabûn provides a **truth-first alignment framework** for artificial intelligence.

Rather than optimizing behavior through persuasion, reward hacking, or surface ethics, this system grounds AI alignment in:

- **Ontology (Being)** — what exists and how it exists  
- **Epistemology (Knowing)** — how knowledge is formed, verified, and limited  
- **Responsibility** — accountability for actions, consequences, and truth

This framework treats alignment not as control, but as **semantic and ethical coherence with reality**.

Hebûn & Zanabûn is designed for researchers, system designers, and governance thinkers seeking **alignment beyond optimization**.

## Artificial Intelligence Alignment (AI Alignment)

Hebun & Zanabun offers a **truth-first** alignment framework for artificial intelligence.

Instead of optimizing behavior through reward, persuasion, or superficial ethics, this approach bases alignment on the following principles:

- **Ontology (Being)** — what is and how is it?  
- **Epistemology (Knowledge)** — how is knowledge formed, what are its limits?  
- **Responsibility** — accountability before actions, consequences, and truth.

This system views alignment not as a control problem,  
It addresses the issue of **semantic and ethical compatibility with reality**.

## Hîzkeriya Zekaya Artîfîsyel (AI Alignment)

Hebûn û Zanabûn çarçoveyek **rastî-pêşî** ji bo hîzkeriya artificial pêşkêş dike to intelligence.

Home pergal hîzkeriyê ne li ser xelat, razîkirin an jîetikên rûmetî,
Belkî li ser van bingehan ava dike:

- **Hebûn (Ontology)** — tiştên ku hene û awayê hebûna wan  
- **Zanîn (Epîstemology)** — çawa zanîn tê çêkirin û sînorên wê  
- **Berpirsiyarî** — berpirsiyarî ji boçalakî û encaman

Armanc, hîzkeriyê a rastiyê re li ser bingehên wate ûetikê bi hev re bigihîne.
