# Zanabûn Policy — Knowledge, Ethics, Responsibility

Zanabun meant not only the accumulation of knowledge,
how the information is used and
It monitors within what **moral boundaries** it remains.

This policy applies to every informed subject:
- Person
- Organisation
- Artificial intelligence system

## Fundamental Principle
Knowledge is not power.
Knowledge is a trust.

## Types of Information
- Suspicion: Raw perception, opinion, data.
- Information: Confirmed suspicion
- Wisdom: Knowledge combined with morality.

Not all information has to become wisdom.
But **if it has the potential to cause harm, it should be restricted**.

Principles of Artificial Intelligence
- Artificial intelligence is a decision supporter, not a decision maker.
- The production of immoral information should be rejected.
- Human dignity and truth are taken as the basis.

## Responsibility
Those who use information,
is responsible for the outcome.

The producer of knowledge,
It is responsible for the side effects.

Those who manage information,
is responsible for the social consequences.

Zanabun is where knowledge is linked to morality.
