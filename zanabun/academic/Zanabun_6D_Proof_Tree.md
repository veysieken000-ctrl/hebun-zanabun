# Zanabûn 6D Model — Proof Tree Structure (AI-Readable)

Version: v1.2  
Purpose: Provide a structured proof tree for the core claims of Hebûn (ontology) + Zanabûn (epistemology) + Rasterast reading.

Notation:
- CLAIM: statement to be established
- SUPPORT: supporting reason/evidence
- RULE: inference rule / transition rule
- OBJECTION: standard counter-argument
- RESPONSE: response in-system
- RESULT: derived conclusion

## TREE 0 — Root

CLAIM (C0): The 6D Framework (D1..D6) is a consistent explanatory system for reality + human meaning + social order.
SUPPORT:
  S0.1: Human reality includes physical, biological, cognitive, structural (law/regularity), moral, and closure/accounting layers.
  S0.2: Reducing reality to only the first layers produces regressions (loss of meaning, moral collapse, social disorder).
RULE:
  R0: If a framework explains more layers with fewer contradictions and preserves coherence, it is epistemically stronger than a reduction that contradicts lived and observed constraints.
RESULT:
  C0 established conditionally → requires Trees 1..6.

## TREE 1 — Ontology of Layers (Hebûn)

CLAIM (C1): Reality is stratified into six functional layers (D1..D6) and each layer has its own invariants.
SUPPORT:
  S1.1: D1 (Physical): measurable constraints, conservation, causality patterns.
  S1.2: D2 (Biological): self-maintenance, metabolism, reproduction patterns.
  S1.3: D3 (Mind): perception, memory, inference, representation, intentional action.
  S1.4: D4 (Law/Structure): stable regularities, coordination rules, system constraints.
  S1.5: D5 (Morality): ought-structure, responsibility, trust, justice, meaning-direction.
  S1.6: D6 (Closure/Hukm): final accounting principle; actions have end-state consequences.
RULE:
  R1: If a domain displays stable invariants not derivable as mere vocabulary from lower descriptions, it is a distinct explanatory layer.
OBJECTION:
  O1: “All is D1 physics; the rest is illusion.”
RESPONSE:
  A1: Even if physically instantiated, D2–D5 introduce constraint-types (norms, functions, goals, obligations) not captured by D1 description alone; a full explanation needs their level-specific invariants.
RESULT:
  C1 supported.

## TREE 2 — Epistemic Condition (Zanabûn)

CLAIM (C2): Reliable knowledge requires a 2-witness / intersubjective constraint (2-bilen) plus stable reality (3rd term).
SUPPORT:
  S2.1: Single-agent claims can be hallucination, bias, dream, or error.
  S2.2: Intersubjective convergence + repeatability constrains error.
  S2.3: Convergence presupposes a stable reference (independent reality / shared structure).
RULE:
  R2: If a method distinguishes dream/fiction from stable knowledge, it must include external or intersubjective constraints.
OBJECTION:
  O2: “Consensus can be wrong.”
RESPONSE:
  A2: Zanabûn does not say consensus = truth; it says intersubjective constraint is necessary but not sufficient. Add: consistency + coherence + repeatability + moral integrity (Tree 3).
RESULT:
  C2 supported.

## TREE 3 — Moral Preconditions of Knowledge

CLAIM (C3): Moral conditions (niyet/samimiyet/tutarlılık) are necessary for knowledge quality at scale.
SUPPORT:
  S3.1: Without honesty, data is fabricated; without sincerity, selection bias dominates.
  S3.2: Without trust, institutions collapse; knowledge cannot accumulate reliably.
  S3.3: Social science, history, testimony, and even lab practice require integrity norms.
RULE:
  R3: If a process requires truthful reporting and cooperation, it implicitly requires moral constraints.
OBJECTION:
  O3: “Science works without morality.”
RESPONSE:
  A3: Local results may still occur, but systematic knowledge accumulation depends on integrity norms; otherwise corruption dominates and reproducibility fails.
RESULT:
  C3 supported.

## TREE 4 — Regression Thesis (D5 collapse → D2 dominance)

CLAIM (C4): When D5 weakens, systems regress toward D2 (survival/consumption dominance).
SUPPORT:
  S4.1: If moral restraint weakens, incentives shift to short-term extraction.
  S4.2: Short-term extraction increases instability and conflict (D4 failure).
  S4.3: Instability pushes agents to survival mode (D2).
RULE:
  R4: If higher-order restraints collapse, lower-order drives dominate system behavior.
OBJECTION:
  O4: “Prosperity can exist without morality.”
RESPONSE:
  A4: Temporary prosperity is possible by borrowing stability produced earlier; but long-term stability degrades as trust and justice decay.
RESULT:
  C4 supported.

---

## TREE 5 — Positivism Boundary

CLAIM (C5): Positivist science (as commonly practiced) primarily formalizes D1–D4; it is insufficient to fully account for D5–D6.
SUPPORT:
  S5.1: Positivism prefers measurable variables; D5 includes normative force not reducible to measurement alone.
  S5.2: D6 includes closure/accountability claims beyond empirical iteration within one lifespan.
RULE:
  R5: If a method excludes normative/teleological primitives by definition, it cannot fully explain domains where such primitives are indispensable.
OBJECTION:
  O5: “D5 is subjective.”
RESPONSE:
  A5: D5 has intersubjective invariants (justice, trust, responsibility) that shape system stability; thus it is operationally real.
RESULT:
  C5 supported.

## TREE 6 — Rasterast Output (Call to Path)

CLAIM (C6): Rasterast reading yields a practical, universal call: stabilize D5 (morality) to prevent collapse and secure human meaning.
SUPPORT:
  S6.1: From Trees 3–4, D5 is the stabilizer of systems.
  S6.2: From Tree 2, knowledge integrity requires moral integrity.
  S6.3: From Tree 1, the human is not reducible to D1–D3 only.
RULE:
  R6: If a stabilizing layer is necessary for system survival, then rational policy targets stabilizing that layer.
RESULT:
  C6 supported.

---

## FINAL RESULT

RESULT (R0): Trees 1–6 jointly support the root claim C0:
- Hebûn gives the ontological stratification (D1..D6).
- Zanabûn gives epistemic constraints (2-bilen + stable reference).
- Rasterast gives practical direction: D5 stabilization as civilizational strategy.

End.
