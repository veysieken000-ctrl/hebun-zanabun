Abstract
This paper presents a formal modal and symbolic articulation of the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework, a six-dimensional ontological-epistemological model. The objective is to demonstrate that the expansion from four-dimensional positivist epistemology to a six-dimensional layered ontology is not metaphysical speculation but a logical necessity derived from structural incompleteness in reductionist systems.
The study provides:
Modal logical structure
Symbolic notation system
Type structure
Computational pseudocode abstraction
Formal necessity proof outline
1. Problem Statement
Classical positivist epistemology operates within:
F = {Physical, Biological, Cognitive, Formal-Legal}
However, moral agency and intentional consciousness cannot be reduced to these layers without contradiction.
Thus, a dimensional incompleteness problem arises.
2. Dimensional Expansion Thesis
Define the dimensional set:
D = {D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, D₅, D₆}
Where:
D₁ = Physical
D₂ = Biological
D₃ = Cognitive
D₄ = Structural / Legal
D₅ = Moral–Intentional
D₆ = Ultimate Judgement / Transcendent Completion
The thesis:
∀ system S,
If S explains D₁–D₄ but fails to explain intentional normativity,
Then S is dimensionally incomplete.
3. Modal Logical Structure
We define:
□ = structural necessity
◇ = structural possibility
Core axiom:
□(Incomplete(F₄) → ∃D₅ ∧ ∃D₆)
Meaning:
Necessarily, if the 4D system is incomplete, then moral and ultimate dimensions must exist to preserve coherence.
4. Symbolic Structure
Let:
x ∈ V (V = ontological entities)
K(x) = epistemic status of x
M(x) = moral valence
H(x) = hukm-status (judgement outcome)
Full evaluation function:
H(x) = f(D₁(x), D₂(x), D₃(x), D₄(x), D₅(x), D₆(x))
Reductionist models define:
H₄(x) = f(D₁–D₄)
But:
H₄(x) ≠ H(x)
Thus:
□(H requires D₅ ∧ D₆)
5. Type System
Define types:
Entity ::= Physical | Biological | Cognitive | Structural | Moral | Judgemental
Decision ::= Action → MoralState
MoralState ::= Expansion | Contraction
Judgement ::= TerminalEvaluation
6. Computational Abstraction

function Evaluate(entity x):
    layers = ExtractLayers(x)

    if Missing(layers.D5) or Missing(layers.D6):
        return "Dimensional Incompleteness"

    return Integrate(layers.D1..D6)
7. Structural Proof Sketch
Intentional agency exists.
Intentional agency implies normativity.
Normativity implies evaluation beyond physical causality.
Evaluation implies moral layer.
Moral layer implies final resolution condition.
Therefore, 6-dimensional closure is necessary.
Q.E.D.
8. Epistemic Position
This framework does not negate positivist science.
It embeds it within a layered ontological completion.
Zanabûn does not reject empirical method.
It completes its dimensional insufficiency.
9. Conclusion
The six-dimensional model is not metaphysical excess but structural necessity.
Any system explaining human reality must include:
Ontological layers
Moral evaluation
Final closure
Without closure, the system remains ontologically open and incomplete.
