# Zanabûn 6D Model — Category-Theoretic Structure

Version: v1.2  
Layer: Structural Abstraction

---

## 1. Objects (Dimensions as Objects)

Let:

D₁ = Physical  
D₂ = Biological  
D₃ = Cognitive  
D₄ = Structural  
D₅ = Moral  
D₆ = Closure

Each Dᵢ is treated as an object in category C.

---

## 2. Morphisms (Transformations)

There exist morphisms:

f₁: D₁ → D₂  
f₂: D₂ → D₃  
f₃: D₃ → D₄  
f₄: D₄ → D₅  
f₅: D₅ → D₆  

These represent emergence mappings.

---

## 3. Composition Law

Composition holds:

f₅ ∘ f₄ ∘ f₃ ∘ f₂ ∘ f₁ : D₁ → D₆

This defines ontological completion.

---

## 4. Non-Reducibility Condition

There is no inverse morphism:

¬∃ g : D₅ → D₁

Meaning:

Higher moral structure is not reducible to physical structure.

---

## 5. Closure Property

D₆ acts as terminal object T in C.

For every Dᵢ, there exists a unique morphism:

∀ Dᵢ ∈ C, ∃! uᵢ : Dᵢ → T

Thus, all dimensions converge structurally to D₆.

## 6. Structural Interpretation

The model is not metaphysical.

It defines:

• Ordered emergence  
• Non-reducibility  
• Terminal closure  

Within categorical logic.
