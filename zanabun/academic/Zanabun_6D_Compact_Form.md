# Zanabûn 6D Model — Compact Symbolic Form

Version: v1.2  
Layer: Symbolic Compression

---

## 1. Dimension Set

Let:

D = {D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, D₅, D₆}

Where:

D₁ = Physical  
D₂ = Biological  
D₃ = Cognitive  
D₄ = Structural  
D₅ = Moral  
D₆ = Closure  

---

## 2. Emergence Chain

D₁ ⊂ D₂ ⊂ D₃ ⊂ D₄ ⊂ D₅ ⊂ D₆

Strict inclusion:

∀ i < j → Dᵢ ⊊ Dⱼ

---

## 3. Non-Reduction Axiom

∀ i < j :

¬(Dⱼ ⊆ Dᵢ)

Higher layers are not reducible downward.

---

## 4. Moral Activation Condition

Let H be human agents.

Moral stabilization requires:

∀ h ∈ H :

Stability(h) ⇔ Activation(D₅)

---

## 5. Collapse Condition

If Activation(D₅) = 0  
→ System regresses toward D₂

Symbolically:

¬D₅ ⇒ Regression(D₂)

---

## 6. Terminal Convergence

Limit(Dᵢ) → D₆

All dimensions converge structurally toward closure.

---

## 7. System Definition

Zanabûn = Ordered Emergence + Non-Reduction + Moral Activation + Terminal Closure

---

End of compact representation.
