Version: v1.2  
Layer: Ontological Completion Proof

---

## Definitions

D₁ = Physical layer  
D₂ = Biological layer  
D₃ = Cognitive layer  
D₄ = Structural / Legal layer  
D₅ = Moral–Intentional layer  
D₆ = Closure / Ultimate Judgement layer  

Let F₄ = {D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄}  
Let F₆ = {D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, D₅, D₆}

## Lemma 1 — Normativity Emergence

If intentional agency exists, then normativity exists.

Proof Sketch:

1. Humans make decisions.
2. Decisions imply evaluation (good/bad, right/wrong).
3. Evaluation implies normativity.
4. Normativity cannot be reduced to physical causation.

Therefore: D₅ must exist.

---

## Lemma 2 — Evaluation Requires Closure

If normativity exists, then a closure condition must exist.

Reason:

1. Moral evaluation implies consequence.
2. Consequence implies terminal evaluation.
3. Terminal evaluation implies closure layer.

Therefore: D₆ must exist.

## Theorem 1 — Dimensional Incompleteness of F₄

Any system restricted to F₄ cannot explain moral agency.

Proof:

1. F₄ explains physical, biological, cognitive, and structural phenomena.
2. Moral intentionality is not reducible to these.
3. Therefore F₄ is incomplete.

Q.E.D.

## Theorem 2 — Necessity of F₆

If moral agency exists, then F₆ is necessary.

Proof:

From Lemma 1 → D₅ exists.  
From Lemma 2 → D₆ exists.  

Therefore:

F₄ + D₅ + D₆ = F₆ is structurally necessary.

Q.E.D.

## Corollary

The six-dimensional model is not metaphysical speculation.
It is a structural completion requirement.
