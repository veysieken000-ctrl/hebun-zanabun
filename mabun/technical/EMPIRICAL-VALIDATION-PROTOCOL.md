# 1. Purpose

This document defines the empirical testing framework
for validating or falsifying the Mabûn Economic Model.

Mabûn must be:

• Measurable  
• Testable  
• Replicable  
• Falsifiable  

Otherwise it is not scientific.

# 2. Core Hypotheses

H1: Justice coherence (J) is positively correlated with long-term systemic stability (S).

H2: Capital concentration (C) above threshold C* increases collapse probability.

H3: Moral cohesion (M) statistically moderates economic volatility.

H4: Ecological degradation (E decline) predicts long-cycle instability.

H5: Distribution imbalance (D distortion) increases social unrest probability.

# 3. Operationalization of Variables

All variables must be converted into measurable indices.

Justice (J) proxies:
• Rule of Law Index
• Corruption Perception Index
• Judicial independence metrics

Distribution (D):
• Gini coefficient
• Wealth concentration ratios
• Income quintile ratios

Moral Cohesion (M):
• Social trust surveys
• Institutional trust metrics
• Crime rate inverse index

Ecology (E):
• Ecological footprint
• Biodiversity index
• Resource depletion rates

Capital Concentration (C):
• Top 1% wealth share
• Corporate concentration ratios
• Financialization index

Debt Load (K):
• Public debt/GDP
• Household leverage ratio
• Systemic financial exposure

System Stability (S):
• Political stability index
• Civil unrest frequency
• GDP volatility
• Institutional continuity metrics

# 4. Data Sources

Accepted sources:

• World Bank
• IMF
• OECD
• UNDP
• World Governance Indicators
• FAO ecological data
• IPCC environmental datasets

All datasets must be publicly verifiable.

---

# 5. Statistical Methods

Minimum required methods:

• Panel regression analysis
• Structural equation modeling (SEM)
• Granger causality testing
• Time-series stationarity testing
• Sensitivity analysis
• Monte Carlo simulation

Optional advanced layer:

• Machine learning predictive modeling
• Bayesian inference
• Agent-based empirical calibration

---

# 6. Falsification Conditions

Mabûn hypothesis fails if:

1. Justice variable (J) shows no significant predictive power
   over long-term stability.

2. Capital concentration (C) does not increase fragility.

3. Moral cohesion (M) has no measurable buffering effect.

4. Ecological degradation does not correlate with systemic risk.

Failure in ≥2 core hypotheses invalidates structural claim.

---

# 7. Cross-Civilization Testing

Test cases:

• Ottoman decline period
• Renaissance Europe transition
• Post-war economic booms
• Modern debt crises
• Ecological collapse cases

Model must explain:

Why systems rose  
Why systems collapsed  
Why some resisted collapse longer  

---

# 8. Robustness Checks

Required:

• Out-of-sample testing
• Historical backtesting
• Multi-country cross-validation
• Sensitivity to threshold parameters

---

# 9. Replication Requirement

All code must be:

• Publicly accessible
• Version controlled
• Reproducible

No proprietary black-box modeling allowed.

---

# 10. Scientific Position

Mabûn is not ideology.

It is:

A structurally falsifiable economic hypothesis
based on multi-variable stability dynamics.

If validated → civilizational-scale economic paradigm.
If falsified → revised or abandoned.

# 11. Conclusion

This protocol ensures:

Transparency  
Scientific integrity  
Academic credibility  
Q1 journal eligibility  

Evidence > Ideology  
Truth > Power
