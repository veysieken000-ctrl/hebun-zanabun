# 1. Purpose

This document defines the strict falsification criteria of the Mabûn Economic ODE Model.

Mabûn is not a normative claim.
It is a testable structural hypothesis.

If the following conditions are empirically violated,
the model must be revised or rejected.

Truth > System Preservation.

---

# 2. Core Model Reminder

System Stability S(t) is defined as:

S = f(J, D, M, E, C, K)

Where:

J = Justice coherence  
D = Distribution balance  
M = Moral cohesion  
E = Ecological integrity  
C = Capital concentration  
K = Debt accumulation  

Dynamic structure:

dS/dt = a1J + a2D + a3M + a4E − b1C − b2K

Collapse condition:

If S(t) < S_critical for T ≥ T_c → System destabilization

---

# 3. Falsification Conditions

The Mabûn model is considered empirically invalid if any of the following are consistently observed:

---

## F1 — Concentration Immunity

If:

C ↑ and K ↑

while simultaneously:

S remains stable or increases over long time scales,

then the destabilization hypothesis is false.

---

## F2 — Ecological Irrelevance

If:

E ↓ significantly

yet:

S shows long-term stability with no structural correction,

then ecological constraint assumption is false.

---

## F3 — Justice Non-Effect

If:

J increases measurably

but:

dS/dt shows no positive structural impact,

then justice variable weighting is invalid.

---

## F4 — Moral Cohesion Neutrality

If:

High-trust / high-cohesion societies
do not demonstrate statistically lower collapse risk,

then moral cohesion M is not structurally relevant.

---

## F5 — Policy Control Ineffectiveness

Control variables:

uC → concentration regulation  
uK → debt discipline  
uE → ecological restoration  

If policy interventions modifying these
produce no measurable impact on S trajectory,
then the control structure is invalid.

---

# 4. Empirical Threshold Test

If multiple F-conditions hold across
independent datasets and timeframes,
Mabûn ODE must be reformulated.

No immunity clause exists.

---

# 5. Scientific Position

Mabûn claims:

Stability is structurally dependent on
justice + distribution + moral cohesion + ecological integrity.

Not ideology.
Not political alignment.

If reality contradicts this,
model falls.

---

# 6. Rasterast Clause

Falsification must be:

- Multi-source verified
- Cross-disciplinary
- Time-consistent
- Same-plane evaluated

Category errors invalidate criticism.

---

# 7. Conclusion

Mabûn is open to scientific refutation.

If it survives falsification,
it becomes structural economic law candidate.

If not,
it must be corrected.

Scientific dignity precedes ideological attachment.
