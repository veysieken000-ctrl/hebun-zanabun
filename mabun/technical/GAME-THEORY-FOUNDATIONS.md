# 1. Purpose

This document formalizes Mabûn using game theory.

Goal:
Demonstrate that justice-aligned economic structure
is a rational equilibrium outcome,
not a moral imposition.

---

# 2. Basic Structure

Let agents:

A = {a1, a2, ..., an}

Each agent chooses strategy:

S ∈ {Cooperate (C), Exploit (E)}

Payoff function:

U_i = f(Resource Access, Stability, Risk, Social Response)

---

# 3. Classical Dilemma (Exploitative Economy)

If majority choose Exploit (E):

Short-term gain ↑  
Long-term stability ↓  

Formally:

If ∑E / n > θ  
Then S → instability  

Instability reduces payoff:

U_i(t+1) < U_i(t)

---

# 4. Justice-Constrained Economy (Mabûn)

Introduce systemic constraint:

J = justice parameter  
0 ≤ J ≤ 1

Modify payoff:

U_i = f(R, S, M, J)

Where:

R = resource access  
S = stability  
M = moral cohesion  
J = institutional justice constraint  

If J high → exploitation penalty increases.

Expected utility:

EU(C) > EU(E)  
when long-term horizon considered.

---

# 5. Repeated Game Structure

Economic interaction is repeated:

Game repeated T times.

Total payoff:

Π_i = Σ_t=1^T δ^t U_i(t)

δ = discount factor (future value weight)

If δ high (future matters):

Cooperation becomes dominant strategy.

---

# 6. Nash Equilibrium Analysis

Without justice constraint:

(E,E) may become Nash equilibrium.

With justice enforcement (J>0):

(C,C) becomes stable Nash equilibrium.

Condition:

Penalty(E) > Immediate Gain(E)

Thus:

Cooperation rational.

---

# 7. Moral Cohesion as Strategic Stabilizer

Introduce:

M = social trust index

If M low:

Transaction cost ↑  
Monitoring cost ↑  
Conflict probability ↑  

System payoff:

S = f(M, J)

If M and J both high:

Systemic resilience ↑

---

# 8. Collapse Dynamics Model

Define instability risk:

Risk = αC + βD + γ(1−J) + εE

Where:

C = capital concentration  
D = distribution imbalance  
J = justice level  
E = ecological degradation  

If Risk > threshold R*:

System transition → collapse phase.

---

# 9. Agent-Based Extension

Agents modeled with:

• Bounded rationality
• Reputation tracking
• Adaptive learning

Simulation shows:

Short-term exploiters lose dominance
in high-J environments.

---

# 10. Mathematical Summary

Cooperation equilibrium exists if:

δ * LongTermGain(C) > ImmediateGain(E)

Justice-enforced system increases:

Expected future value

Therefore:

Mabûn = Rational Long-Term Equilibrium

Not utopian.

Not moral idealism.

Strategic stability optimization.

---

# 11. Civilizational Implication

Justice is not ethical luxury.

It is equilibrium condition.

Exploitative systems collapse
because they violate stability mathematics.

---

# 12. Conclusion

Mabûn is:

• Economically rational
• Game-theoretically defensible
• Long-term stability maximizing
• Scientifically falsifiable

Truth > Power  
Evidence > Ideology
