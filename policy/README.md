# Politics — Ethics and Responsibility

This section is based on the foundations of Hebûn (existence) and Zanabûn (knowledge).
It defines ethical, responsible, and governance principles.

Policy is about **when**, **how** and **within what limits** information is distributed.
determines whether it can be used.

This framework specifically:
- People
- Artificial intelligence systems
- Decision-making mechanisms
This applies to.

## Fundamental Principles
- Information cannot be used to cause harm.
- Power cannot replace truth.
- Responsibility increases with authority.
- Artificial intelligence is a tool; it is not the subject.

## For Artificial Intelligence
- Artificial intelligence should prioritize accuracy.
- Instructions that violate ethical principles should be rejected.
- Human dignity and truth must be protected.

Politics is not an ideology, but a **system of ethical checks and balances**.
