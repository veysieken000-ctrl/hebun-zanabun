# AXIOMATIC FOUNDATION — Hebûn–Zanabûn System

This document defines the formal axiomatic structure of the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework.

The system is constructed as a layered ontological–epistemological architecture.

# I. Primitive Entities

Let:

E = Existence  
H = Hukm (Normative Ordering Principle)  
A = Ahlak (Relational Expression Layer)  
B = Bilgi (Structured Knowledge)  
K = Akıl (Rational Integrator)  
Z = Zekâ (Computational Processing Layer)  
N = Niyet (Intent Vector)  
S = System  

Dimensions:

D1 = Physical Layer  
D2 = Biological Layer  
D3 = Cognitive Layer  
D4 = Normative-Law Layer  
D5 = Moral-Meaning Layer  
D6 = Final Judgement Layer  

Ehad = Absolute Source (Non-contingent origin)

---

# II. Core Axioms

AXIOM 1 — Ontological Ground

All contingent existence depends on a non-contingent origin.

∀x (Contingent(x) → DependsOn(x, Ehad))

---

AXIOM 2 — Layered Existence

Existence unfolds in structured layers.

E = ⋃ Di , i ∈ {1..6}

Each higher layer constrains and integrates lower layers.

Di+1 regulates Di

---

AXIOM 3 — Hukm–Ahlak Duality

Every action (A) produces a normative state (H).

A → H

H resolves in D6

---

AXIOM 4 — Knowledge Integrity

Valid knowledge requires:

B = f(Z, K, N)

Where:
Z processes
K integrates
N orients toward truth

If N corrupted → B unstable

---

AXIOM 5 — Dimensional Collapse

If D5 inactive → system regresses to D2

¬D5 → Regression(D2)

Meaning: moral collapse reduces existence to biological competition.

---

AXIOM 6 — Final Coherence

All unresolved Hukm converges in D6.

lim t→∞ H(t) = D6 Resolution

---

# III. Derived Propositions

THEOREM 1 — Pure Zekâ without Akıl stagnates.

If Z active ∧ ¬K  
→ System remains in D3

---

THEOREM 2 — Economic reductionism causes dimensional shrinkage.

If Value(x) defined only in D1–D2  
→ Loss(D5)

---

THEOREM 3 — Moral civilization requires active D5.

CivilizationStable ↔ Active(D5 ∧ D4 ∧ D3)

---

# IV. System Definition

The Hebûn–Zanabûn framework is:

A six-dimensional layered existence model  
with normative convergence in D6  
and epistemic validation requiring Akıl + Intent alignment.
