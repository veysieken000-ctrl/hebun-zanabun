# Hebûn: 6-Dimensional Existence Model (Technical Framework)

## Abstract
Hebûn defines existence as a layered system progressing from physical reality to moral judgement. The model uses six dimensions: (1) Physics, (2) Biology, (3) Mind/Intellect, (4) Law/Order, (5) Morality/Free Will, (6) Judgement/Outcome. It aims to provide a unified language that can address materialist reductionism while remaining compatible with rational inquiry.

## 1. Purpose
- Define existence with a layered model.
- Separate domains: Hebûn (ontology) vs Zanabûn (epistemology) vs Rasterast (meta-approach).
- Provide a globally readable, controlled vocabulary.

## 2. Core Definitions
**Dimension (D):** a layer that contains and constrains the lower layers.  
**Existence (Hebûn):** what appears through layered constraints and produces stable outcomes.  
**Knowledge (Zanabûn):** validated meanings produced by a knowing subject in relation to an object.

## 3. The Six Dimensions
### D1 — Physics (Power / Kudret)
Matter-energy, forces, atoms, stars.

### D2 — Biology (Information / Bilgi)
Cells, DNA/RNA/protein, reproduction, metabolism.

### D3 — Mind (Perception / Zihin)
Senses, memory, intelligence; human reason as advanced stage.

### D4 — Law/Order (Rules / Kanun)
Stable regularities that govern systems; “order” as constraint over D1–D3.

### D5 — Morality (Free Will / Ahlak)
Ability to choose good/evil; responsibility; intention.

### D6 — Judgement (Outcome / Hüküm)
Finalization of moral direction; consequence beyond the temporal system.

## 4. Domain Boundaries (Do not mix)
- **Hebûn (Ontology):** what exists and its layered structure (D1–D6).
- **Zanabûn (Epistemology):** how knowledge works (mostly D1–D4 as science-domain).
- **Rasterast (Approach):** reading existence+knowledge with iman+akıl, aiming for sirat al-mustaqim.

## 5. Minimal Claims (global language)
1) Lower layers do not fully explain higher layers.  
2) Higher layers constrain lower layers.  
3) Moral agency (D5) is real and has consequences (D6).  

## 6. What This Model Is Not
- Not a replacement for empirical science.
- Not “metaphor only”: it proposes a strict layer logic.

## 7. Roadmap
- Controlled vocabulary (Concepts).
- Epistemology paper (Zanabûn).
- Public manifesto summary.
- FAQ for materialism/positivism critiques.
