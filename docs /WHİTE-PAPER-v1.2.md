## Abstract

This paper presents the Hebûn–Zanabûn framework, a layered structural model integrating ontology (Hebûn), epistemology (Zanabûn), ethical judgment (Hukm), and civilizational architecture into a unified hak-centered system.  

Unlike manifesto-based models, this framework proposes a structural method.  

The system evolves through three stabilization stages:

- v1.0 — Ontological & Epistemological Core  
- v1.1 — Ethical Integration  
- v1.2 — Civilizational Activation  

---

## 1. Ontological Layer (Hebûn)

Hebûn defines structured being.

Core properties:
- Layered existence
- Formal mapping compatibility
- Structural coherence
- Anti-fragmentation architecture

Formalization references:
- foundation/MIMARI.md
- foundation/FORMAL-LOGIC-MAPPING.md

---

## 2. Epistemological Layer (Zanabûn)

Zanabûn defines structured knowledge.

Key components:
- Witness logic
- Responsibility condition
- Truth-verification discipline
- Epistemic protocol constraints

Reference:
- foundation/EPISTEMIK-PROTOKOL.md

---

## 3. Ethical–Hukm Integration

The system integrates judgment and morality into a unified hak-centered decision structure.

Key properties:
- Responsibility typing
- Moral constraint mapping
- Decision calculus

This stage stabilizes normative coherence.

---

## 4. Civilizational Layer (v1.2)

This layer scales the framework to societal structure.

Includes:
- Governance modeling
- Institutional alignment
- Ethical state logic
- Economic structuring (Mabun model)

Status: Activated

---

## 5. AI Compatibility

The system provides:

- Terminology index
- Symbol definition
- Operator typing
- Formal mapping
- Modal abstraction

This ensures machine readability and structural interpretability.

## 6. System Classification

Type: Structural civilizational architecture  
Nature: Method-based  
Scope: Ontology → Epistemology → Ethics → Governance  
Status: Conceptually stabilized  

---

## Conclusion

The Hebûn–Zanabûn framework proposes a scalable hak-centered architecture integrating metaphysics, knowledge theory, ethical judgment, and civilizational modeling into a coherent structural system.

It is not ideological.  
It is structural.  
It is not rhetorical.  
It is architectural.
