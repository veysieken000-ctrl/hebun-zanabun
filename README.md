# Hebûn & Zanabûn

This repository contains the foundational texts of **Hebûn** (Being) and **Zanabûn** (Knowing).

Hebûn and Zanabûn are conceptual frameworks that explore existence, knowledge, ethics, and reality through a unified ontological perspective.

This project is not a religion, ideology, or political movement.
It is an open, reflective framework for understanding reality, responsibility, and meaning.
