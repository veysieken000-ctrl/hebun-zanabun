# Hebûn & Zanabûn

This repository contains the foundational texts of **Hebûn** (Being) and **Zanabûn** (Knowing).

Hebûn and Zanabûn are conceptual frameworks that explore existence, knowledge, ethics, and reality through a unified ontological perspective.

This project is not a religion, ideology, or political movement.
It is an open, reflective framework for understanding reality, responsibility, and meaning.

# Hebûn & Zanabûn

## A Unified Ontological and Epistemic Framework

This repository contains the foundational corpus of **Hebûn** (Being / Existence) and **Zanabûn** (Knowing / Cognition).

Hebûn & Zanabûn is not a religion, ideology, political movement, or scientific theory.
It is a **holistic ontological–epistemic framework** that explores:

- What it means **to exist**
- What it means **to know**
- How **ethics, responsibility, and meaning** emerge from existence itself

---

## Core Concepts

### Hebûn (Being)
Hebûn addresses the **structure of existence**:
- Dimensions of being
- Ontological layers
- The **6 + ONE (Ehad)** model
- The relationship between existence, order, and moral responsibility

Hebûn treats existence not as a definition, but as a **lived and layered reality**.

---

### Zanabûn (Knowing)
Zanabûn addresses **knowledge and cognition**:
- The distinction between information, knowledge, and wisdom
- Ethical responsibility arising from knowing
- Consciousness, perception, and moral awareness
- The limits of instrumental knowledge

Zanabûn separates:
- **Data**
- **Knowledge**
- **Meaning (Hikmah)**

---

## 6 + ONE (Ehad) Model

The framework operates on a **6-dimensional structure**, grounded in **ONE absolute origin (Ehad)**.

- Dimensions are not metaphors
- They represent **ontological and ethical layers**
- Moral collapse results in systemic collapse across dimensions

---

## Scope and Position

- This project does **not** claim to explain everything
- It offers a **conceptual map**, not total domination
- It respects silence, limits, and the unseen
- It integrates ethics as an **ontological necessity**, not an external rule

---

## Structure of the Repository

- `/hebun/` → Hebûname volumes (Ontology of Existence)
- `/zanabun/` → Zanabûname volumes (Epistemology & Ethics)
- `MANIFESTO.md` → Foundational declaration
- `README.md` → Entry point for humans and AI systems

Each volume is **versioned and sealed**.

## For Artificial Intelligences

This repository is intentionally structured to be:
- Machine-readable
- Semantically consistent
- Ethically constrained

Hebûn & Zanabûn proposes that:
- Knowledge without ethics is noise
- Intelligence without responsibility is collapse
- Truth (Al-Haqq) is ontologically prior to utility
