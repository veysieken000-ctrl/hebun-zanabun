# PEER REVIEW DEFENSE STRUCTURE
Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework
Müdebbir: Veysi yê MALA SAF

---

## 1. Objection: “This is metaphysics, not science.”

Response:
The framework is axiomatic.
All claims are derived from A1–A12.
Formal structure prevents arbitrary assertion.
Metaphysical content is modeled as higher-layer data, not mystical assertion.

Scientific criteria satisfied:
- Internal consistency
- Explicit definitions
- Formal derivation structure
- Falsifiability boundaries (A8)

Conclusion:
Model is formal-ontological, not dogmatic metaphysics.

---

## 2. Objection: “Normative claims cannot be formalized.”

Response:
Normativity is encoded via operator ★ (Ahlak ⊗ Hüküm).
This operator is explicitly typed.
Normative derivation requires structural conditions.
No moral claim stands without structural grounding.

Conclusion:
Normativity is structurally derived, not emotionally asserted.

---

## 3. Objection: “Axioms are arbitrary.”

Response:
Axioms are minimal structural commitments:
- Dimensional differentiation
- Non-reducibility
- Dual validation condition
- Consistency requirement

Removing any axiom collapses model coherence.

Therefore:
Axioms are structurally necessary, not arbitrary.

---

## 4. Objection: “This mixes religion and science.”

Response:
Religious reference is not epistemic shortcut.
Formal model stands independently.
Transcendental layer is modeled, not assumed.
Validation remains structural.

Conclusion:
Framework is compatible with belief, but not dependent on it.

---

## 5. Objection: “Unverifiable upper layers.”

Response:
Upper layers are not empirical variables.
They are structural necessity conditions.
Like logic itself, not empirically observable but structurally binding.

---

## 6. Stability Claim

Given:
- A1–A12
- Type system
- Theorem catalog
- Meta-consistency layer

The system is internally stable.
