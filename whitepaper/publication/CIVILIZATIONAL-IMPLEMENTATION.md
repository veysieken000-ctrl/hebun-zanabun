## Abstract

This paper describes how the 6-layer dimensional model 
translates into civilizational architecture.

The aim is not ideological domination,
but structural stabilization of society through
ontological clarity and epistemic integrity.

# 1. Civilizational Principle

A civilization is stable if:

C = (O ⊗ E ⊗ N ⊗ G ⊗ J)

Where:

O = Ontology (Hebûn)
E = Epistemology (Zanabûn)
N = Normativity (Ahlak layer)
G = Governance structure
J = Binding Judgment mechanism

If any component collapses → instability.

---

# 2. Governance Mapping

Dimensional mapping:

Layer 1–2 → Material infrastructure
Layer 3 → Knowledge systems
Layer 4 → Legal mechanisms
Layer 5 → Moral framework
Layer 6 → Final accountability horizon

Governance must reflect layered reality.

Reduction to 1–2 only → economic materialism.
Reduction to 3 only → technocracy.
Reduction to 5 only → moral dogmatism.

Balanced integration required.

# 3. Economic Integration (Mabûn)

Economy must satisfy:

• Survival stability
• Justice alignment
• Moral coherence

Production detached from normativity
creates expansion without meaning.

Mabûn anchors economy in Layer 5.

---

# 4. Civilizational Failure Model

Collapse occurs when:

(1) Moral layer detaches from legal layer
(2) Knowledge layer detaches from ontological layer
(3) Economy detaches from moral layer

Result:
Dimensional contraction.

---

# 5. Civilizational Stabilization Equation

Stable civilization:

S = ∑ (Layer_i coherence)

Instability index:

I = contradictions / structural depth

If I > threshold → collapse trajectory begins.

---

# 6. Civilizational Neutrality Claim

Framework does not impose cultural uniformity.

It provides:

• Structural clarity
• Normative coherence
• Layer awareness

Local cultures may adapt surface forms
while maintaining structural alignment.

---

# 7. Implementation Strategy

Phase 1 — Conceptual Clarification  
Phase 2 — Institutional Alignment  
Phase 3 — Economic Recalibration  
Phase 4 — Normative Consolidation  

---

Status:
Civilizational layer defined.
Implementation-ready model.
