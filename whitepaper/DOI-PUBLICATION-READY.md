Title:
Hebûn–Zanabûn: A Six-Dimensional Onto-Epistemic Architecture

Subtitle:
Formal Ontology, Epistemology, Ethical-Hukm Integration and Civilizational Model

## 2. Abstract (Short)

Hebûn–Zanabûn is a six-dimensional layered ontology and epistemology model
extending classical physical, biological, and cognitive frameworks
into ethical (dimension 5) and hukm (dimension 6) layers.

The system is:
- Axiomatically structured
- Theorem-supported
- Computationally indexable
- Normatively grounded

It proposes a civilizational architecture
based on layered consistency and moral anchoring.
