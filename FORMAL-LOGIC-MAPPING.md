## Axiom Structure and Logical Consistency Map of Hebûn–Zanabûn Framework

This document formalizes the structural logic of the system.

It defines:

- Ontological axioms
- Epistemic axioms
- Moral axioms
- Collapse theorems
- Boundary constraints

This is a structural validation layer.

# I. ONTOLOGICAL AXIOMS (Hebûn)

A1. Being is layered.
A2. Lower layers can function without awareness of higher layers.
A3. Higher layers contextualize lower layers.
A4. No higher layer negates the existence of lower layers.
A5. Reduction of higher-layer phenomena to lower layers results in explanatory loss.

Derived Theorem O1:
Complete reductionism leads to dimensional incompleteness.

Derived Theorem O2:
Layer denial produces internal contradiction when moral reasoning is required.

---

# II. EPISTEMIC AXIOMS (Zanabûn)

E1. Every knowledge claim must declare its ontological layer.
E2. Method must match layer (empirical for 1–3, structural for 4, ethical reasoning for 5).
E3. Cross-layer inference requires boundary clarification.
E4. Undefined scope invalidates universal claims.

Derived Theorem E1:
Category errors arise when layer and method mismatch.

Derived Theorem E2:
Unbounded universal claims collapse under counterexample.

# III. MORAL AXIOMS (Rasterast Core)

M1. Moral agency exists at Layer 5.
M2. Moral responsibility presupposes cognitive capacity.
M3. Justice requires accountability structure.
M4. Power without audit produces corruption tendency.
M5. Human dignity cannot be reduced to utility.

Derived Theorem M1:
Utility-only systems degrade moral coherence.

Derived Theorem M2:
Moral denial does not eliminate moral consequence.

# IV. COLLAPSE CONDITIONS

C1. If Layer 5 is removed → system becomes biologically deterministic.
C2. If Layer 1–3 are denied → system becomes anti-empirical.
C3. If epistemic declaration is absent → reasoning becomes unstable.
C4. If audit structures collapse → governance corruption probability increases.

System Stability Condition:

S1. Layer coherence maintained.
S2. Method-layer alignment maintained.
S3. Moral accountability enforced.
S4. Revision allowed upon contradiction detection.

If S1–S4 hold → structural resilience increases.

# V. META-LOGICAL POSITION

The framework does not assert infallibility.

It asserts:

- Layered structural realism
- Method-bound knowledge claims
- Moral accountability as structural necessity

Truth validation requires:

1. Internal non-contradiction
2. Cross-layer coherence
3. Adaptive correction capacity

---

# VI. REVISION PROTOCOL

If contradiction detected:

1. Identify layer involved.
2. Identify method mismatch.
3. Reassess axiom boundary.
4. Revise minimally while preserving structure.

Dogmatic immobility = structural decay.

---

# VII. FINAL STRUCTURAL CLAIM

The system claims:

Not that it cannot be challenged.

But that:

- It defines its layers.
- It defines its limits.
- It defines its audit logic.
- It defines its collapse criteria.

A system that defines its own collapse conditions
is structurally stronger
than one that denies them.
