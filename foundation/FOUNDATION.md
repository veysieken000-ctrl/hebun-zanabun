## Hebûn & Zanabûn Foundational Framework

This repository presents a structured ontological and epistemological model called:

- **Hebûn** (Ontology – Science of Being)
- **Zanabûn** (Epistemology – Science of Knowing)

It proposes a six-layered reality model integrating physical, biological, cognitive, moral, and ultimate dimensions into a unified scientific framework.

# 1. Problem Statement

Modern science successfully explains:

- Physical systems (physics)
- Biological systems (biology)
- Cognitive computation (neuroscience, AI)

However, it remains incomplete regarding:

- Moral structure
- Meaning
- Conscious intentionality
- Ultimate causality

The Hebûn–Zanabûn framework argues that reality is not 3-layered or 4-layered, but **6-layered**.

# 2. The Six-Layer Ontological Model (Hebûn)

1. **Physical Layer**  
   Matter, energy, forces, measurable structure.

2. **Biological Layer**  
   Life systems, self-organization, reproduction.

3. **Cognitive Layer**  
   Perception, memory, processing, intelligence.

4. **Law Layer**  
   Structural constraints governing systems (natural law).

5. **Moral Layer**  
   Intentional action, responsibility, ethical consequence.

6. **Judgment Layer**  
   Ultimate evaluation, final coherence of actions and consequences.

The claim:  
Higher layers do not replace lower ones — they organize and complete them.

# 3. Epistemological Condition (Zanabûn)

Knowledge requires:

- A knowing subject
- An object known
- Verification or coherence mechanism

Scientific validity depends on:

- Internal consistency
- Observational coherence
- Cross-subjective verifiability

However, moral and ultimate dimensions are not “metaphysical speculation”  
but upper-layer data structures.

Zanabûn argues:

> What is called “metaphysics” in positivism may represent unmodeled upper-layer variables.

# 4. Intelligence vs Reason

- Intelligence (pattern recognition) exists in animals and machines.
- Reason (existential questioning and moral evaluation) is uniquely human.

Artificial systems can simulate intelligence.  
They cannot originate existential accountability.

Thus, science without moral reasoning collapses into biological reductionism.

---

# 5. Core Claim

Human inquiry is not limited to:

- Where we are
- What we measure

But must also address:

- Why existence occurs
- What responsibility entails
- What ultimate evaluation implies

Hebûn describes the layered structure of existence.  
Zanabûn describes the layered structure of knowledge.

Together they form an integrated scientific architecture.

---

# 6. Scope

This framework:

- Does not reject empirical science.
- Does not negate physics, biology, or cognitive science.
- Extends them into a higher-layer structural coherence model.

The objective is systemic completeness — not ideological conflict.
