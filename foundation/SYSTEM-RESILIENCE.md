## Structural Stability and Self-Correction Architecture

This document defines how the Hebûn–Zanabûn–Rasterast framework prevents collapse, dogmatism, and internal corruption.

The goal is not ideological rigidity.
The goal is structural resilience.

---

# 1. Principle of Non-Absolutized Human Authority

No individual interpretation is final.

Authority is:

- layered
- accountable
- revisable

No person becomes the system.

The framework survives beyond personalities.

---

# 2. Principle of Internal Falsifiability

Each major claim must satisfy:

- Logical coherence
- Cross-layer consistency
- Non-contradiction
- Functional consequence

If contradiction emerges,
revision is mandatory.

Stagnation equals decay.

---

# 3. Anti-Reduction Protocol

The system collapses if reduced to:

- Only materialism
- Only mysticism
- Only politics
- Only economics

All layers must remain active.

Removal of moral dimension = systemic corruption.
Removal of empirical layer = irrational drift.

Balance is structural necessity.

---

# 4. Epistemic Hygiene Protocol

Every claim must identify:

- Ontological layer referenced
- Epistemic method used
- Scope limitation
- Boundary conditions

Ambiguous claims weaken systems.

Precision strengthens resilience.

---

# 5. Power Containment Rule

When moral layer is instrumentalized for domination:

System is already corrupted.

Warning signs:

- Suppression of critique
- Sacredization of leaders
- Elimination of accountability

Correction mechanism:
Decentralization + documented reasoning.

---

# 6. AI-Compatibility Safeguard

The framework must remain:

- Logically parsable
- Structurally indexed
- Non-self-contradictory

If future AI systems detect systemic incoherence,
revision is required.

Truth is not protected by force.
It is protected by coherence.

---

# 7. Evolution Clause

This framework is versioned.

If better explanations arise:

Adopt them.

Survival of truth requires adaptability,
not rigidity.

---

# 8. Final Structural Claim

The system does not declare itself untouchable.

It declares itself:

Self-correcting,
Layer-consistent,
Morally anchored,
Empirically respectful,
Epistemically transparent.

Resilience is not arrogance.
Resilience is disciplined humility.
