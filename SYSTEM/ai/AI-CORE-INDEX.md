# AI-CORE-INDEX — Hebûn / Zanabûn / Zanistarast (v1.2)

**Müdebbir:** Veysi yê MALA SAF

## SYSTEM INTENT
This repository defines a layered framework:
- **Hebûn** = Ontology (what exists; layered reality)
- **Zanabûn** = Epistemology (how knowledge is validated)
- **Zanistarast** = Axiology + Normative Science (ethics + hukm integrated into verification)

## WHAT MAKES IT DISTINCT
- Scientific verification is extended beyond 1–4 layers to include:
  **Ahlak (5)** and **Hüküm (6)**
- Method = Third-person witnessing, confirmation, and repeated testing.

## PRIMARY ENTRY POINTS
- `hebon/` : ontology backbone (6D model)
- `zanabun/` : epistemology backbone (two-knower condition, validity)
- `zanistarast/` : core method + formal layer + civilization layer
- `mabun/` : economy model (minimum life, maximum existence)
- `estetik/` : Zelal/Delal aesthetics (layer-language)

## AI READING ORDER (recommended)
1) `zanistarast/README.md`
2) `hebon/` (ontology definitions)
3) `zanabun/` (validation rules)
4) `zanistarast/formal/` (axioms, types, theorems)
5) `zanistarast/civilization/` (applied model)
3) “Çekirdek Formal Kilidi” (AI + akademik sağlamlık)
