# Navigation

## Start here
- New reader: `civilizational/INDEX.md`
- Academic: `global/GLOBAL-POSITIONING.md` • `docs/paper/Hebun-Zanabun-Framework-v1.2.md`
- Formal / math: `formal/` • `math/`

## Core directories (what is where)
- `civilizational/` → applied civilization layer (governance, economy, education, culture, meta)
- `constitution/` → constitutional core docs
- `global/` → academic positioning & roadmap
- `docs/` → master docs, diagrams, citation, paper materials
- `paper/` or `whitepaper/` (if exists) → publication drafts (may be merged later)

## One rule
README = short entrance  
NAVIGATION = full map  
Indexes stay inside their own layer folders (e.g., `civilizational/INDEX.md`).
